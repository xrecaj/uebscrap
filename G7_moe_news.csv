The German government is putting into place an assistance package of historic proportions. The measures contained in this protective shield aim to protect people\xe2\x80\x99s health, to safeguard jobs, to support companies, and to maintain social cohesion.\nSource:\nBundesministerium der Finanzen\nThe German government is taking decisive, vigorous and targeted action to protect the country. The government is deploying the largest assistance package in the history of the Federal Republic. In this way, it is building a protective shield for employees, self-employed people and businesses.\nTo finance this package, the Federation will take out new loans totalling roughly \xe2\x82\xac156 billion. The federal cabinet has approved a supplementary budget for this purpose.\nMultiple measures to safeguard the provision of health care in times of crisis\nThe German government is allocating \xe2\x82\xac3.5 billion for health-related measures including protective equipment as well as the development of a vaccine and additional treatments.An additional \xe2\x82\xac55 billion is being made available to fight the pandemic. This is crucial for enabling flexible responses at short notice as the pandemic develops.The Federation is establishing a protective shield for hospitals to mitigate revenue shortfalls and higher costs.Measures will also be taken to mitigate revenue shortfalls experienced by doctors who have their own practices.Customs authorities are monitoring compliance with the EU\xe2\x80\x99s export ban on protective masks, protective spectacles and protective suits.\nThe German government is also lending a helping hand to families in order to secure their income:\nIf families lose earnings due to the closure of schools or childcare centres, these losses will be covered for the most part. The same applies to freelancers and self-employed people.Families that experience reduced income as a result of working short-time will be given easier access to the child supplement for low-income families.\nFast, very extensive support for small businesses, self-employed individuals and freelancers\nThe Federation is setting up a \xe2\x82\xac50 billion immediate assistance programme (Soforthilfe) to support small businesses, freelancers, and the self-employed. These funds will be used to provide one-time grants to cover operating costs for three months. The grants do not have to be paid back and are designed to involve as little red tape as possible. This federal programme supplements other programmes that have already been adopted by the L\xc3\xa4nder. For this reason, L\xc3\xa4nder authorities will be responsible for handling all applications in order to ensure uniform procedures. The L\xc3\xa4nder will soon announce which specific authorities are responsible for processing applications in each respective Land. The immediate assistance programme provides for the following grants:\nSelf-employed persons and businesses with up to five employees will receive up to \xe2\x82\xac9,000Self-employed persons and businesses with up to 10 employees will receive up to \xe2\x82\xac15,000\nSelf-employed persons will be given easier access to basic income support (Grundsicherung) to ensure that they can support themselves and pay for housing. Means-testing procedures will be suspended for six months, and payments are to be disbursed very quickly.\nComprehensive measures to support the real economy: protecting businesses, employees and jobs\nThe German government is establishing an Economic Stabilisation Fund that is targeted in particular towards large companies and that will be equipped to provide large-scale assistance. The fund supplements the liquidity assistance programmes that have already been adopted as part of KfW\xe2\x80\x99s special programmes. The fund encompasses:\xe2\x82\xac100 billion for equity measures\xe2\x82\xac400 billion for guaranteesUp to \xe2\x82\xac100 billion to refinance existing KfW special programmesA multibillion-euro assistance programme will be set up at KfW, a government-owned promotional bank, for the purpose of providing businesses, self-employed people and freelancers with liquidity. To this end, KfW is making an unlimited volume of credit available through various loan programmes. This will ease the situation particularly for small and medium-sized firms that are experiencing financial difficulties through no fault of their own. Affected companies can access KfW loans via their primary bank. If necessary, they can also access guarantee instruments via their primary bank.\nA detailed overview of the various programmes is available (in German) here.\nTax-related assistance is available to companies of all sizes in order to strengthen their liquidity. The following arrangements apply until the end of 2020 for businesses directly affected by the coronavirus epidemic:\nTax authorities will grant tax payment deferralsTax prepayments can be adjustedEnforcement measures will be suspended\nFor more information click here.\nBusinesses can now apply for access to the short-time work (Kurzarbeit) scheme if at least 10% of their employees are affected by work shortages. Under the scheme, the Federal Employment Agency can pay wage costs and social security contributions on behalf of affected companies. These rules also apply to temporary/agency workers.\nDetailed information on compensation for short-time work is provided (in German) by the Federal Employment Agency.\nJoint crisis management\nThe effects of the coronavirus epidemic are being felt in Germany, in Europe, and around the world. For this reason, it is also crucial to ensure coordination at the European and international level. The Eurogroup has already agreed on an initial package of measures. Federal Finance Minister Scholz remains in regular contact with Germany\xe2\x80\x99s European partners.\nIn addition, ongoing talks are being conducted at the level of the G7 and G20. The G7 finance ministers and central bank governors have declared that they will do \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever is necessary to restore confidence and economic growth and to protect jobs, businesses and the resilience of the financial system.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStatement of G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors\nThe German government is dovetailing its measures with steps being taken by other European governments and welcomes the European Commission\xe2\x80\x99s plan to establish a \xe2\x82\xac25 billion Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative.\nSubject Logo\nArea Menu\nPriority issues\n:\nProtective shield to manage the coronavirus pandemic\n:\nClimate Action\nG7/G20\nFinance Ministry around the world\nPublic Finances\nTaxation\nFinancial Markets\nEurope\nStamps\nAdditional Information\nFAQs provided by Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs\nMore\nPrint this page\nReturn to top\nPage overview\nHome\nIs\xc2\xadsues\nPriority issues\nPublic Finances\nTaxation\nFinancial Markets\nEurope\nStamps\nAbout\nMinister and Senior Leadership\nDirectorates-General\nAdvisory Board\nEvents at the Ministry\nHistory\nVisitors' Service\nDirections\nRe\xc2\xadsources\nPublications\nLaws in English\nMultimedia\nLivestream\nPress\nSpeeches, Interviews and Articles\nPress Releases\nMedia Images\nMedia Contacts\nMetanavigation\nLe\xc2\xadgal No\xc2\xadtice\nPri\xc2\xadva\xc2\xadcy Pol\xc2\xadi\xc2\xadcy\n\xc2\xa9 Federal Ministry of Finance\nVisit the Federal Ministry of Finance on social media and share\nTwitter BMF (Opens\xc2\xa0new\xc2\xa0window)\nInstagram BMF (Opens\xc2\xa0new\xc2\xa0window)\n\xc3\xb6ffnet den YouTube-Kanal des BMF.

With these new budgetary provisions, the government is launching a comprehensive package of measures to protect the health of the people living Germany as well as protecting employees and companies from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.\nWe are ready to do whatever it takes to protect the health of the people living in Germany, to protect jobs and businesses, and to protect our country. We are launching an unprecedented package of assistance measures to fight the crisis. The supplementary budget allows us to implement everything quickly and effectively and ensure that the money reaches those who need it now. We want to get past this crisis in good shape; together, we can achieve this.German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz\nWith the supplementary budget, the German government is taking decisive action to combat the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, in terms of the challenges it poses both to health and to the economy. The additional measures covered by the supplementary budget encompass total expenditure of approximately \xe2\x82\xac122.5bn.\nNevertheless, it must be assumed that GDP will decline significantly this year due to the pandemic. For this reason, the German government is expecting that tax revenue will be lower, with an estimated shortfall of \xe2\x82\xac33.5bn compared to the revenue originally expected when the 2020 budget was planned.\nThanks to the sound fiscal policy practised in recent years, the German government is now in a position to take decisive fiscal action. The pandemic confronts Germany with tremendous challenges. To cover the ensuing costs, Germany will have to borrow roughly \xe2\x82\xac156bn, thereby exceeding the upper limit on borrowing stipulated by Germany\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional debt rules by almost \xe2\x82\xac100bn. However, the German government regards this as an unusual emergency situation that makes it necessary to exceed the limit on borrowing, in line with the sixth sentence of Article 115\xc2\xa0(2) of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz). The final decision on this matter lies with the German Bundestag, where adoption of the budget changes will require approval by a majority of its members.\n2020 supplementary budget: overviewTarget 2020After supplementary budgetGovernment draft 2020 supplementary budgetin \xe2\x82\xacbnExpenditure362.0+122.5484.5Investment expenditure42.9+5.948.8Revenue362.0+122.5484.5Tax revenue325.0-33.5291.5Net borrowing-+156.0156.0\nBreakdown of the measures:\n\xe2\x82\xac50bn will be made available to support small businesses and self-employed persons. These funds are intended as a bridge for self-employed persons, small traders and small businesses whose economic survival would otherwise be at risk.Furthermore, there will be a total increase of roughly \xe2\x82\xac7.7bn in funding for unemployment benefit II (Arbeitslosengeld\xc2\xa0II) as well as the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to housing costs and basic income support for older people. This will ensure a basic standard of living for groups such as the self-employed.In order to stem the spread of the virus, the federal government is making an additional \xe2\x82\xac3.5 billion available for further measures including a) central procurement of personal protective equipment, b) funding for development of a vaccine and treatment, c) support services provided by the Federal Armed Forces, d) assistance for German and EU citizens abroad, and e) public outreach to keep the population informed.Furthermore, the supplementary budget also makes available another \xe2\x82\xac55bn that can be drawn down at short notice to finance further measures to stem the pandemic. This will enable Germany to respond flexibly and at short notice to the further developments and consequences of the pandemic.The German government is also beefing up its provisions by around \xe2\x82\xac5.9bn to cover any claims that may arise, in particular from the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic, in the area of guarantees and securities.\nIn addition, the German government has agreed to put up a protective shield for employees and businesses: This protective shield will, for example, allow for more flexible arrangements for compensating short-time work (Kurzarbeitergeld), tax measures such as optional deferments to improve liquidity for businesses, and new measures relating to the KfW and government guarantees.

In his online speech to the Summit, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz focuses on the need for an international minimum tax in order to ensure that everyone contributes their fair share to the financing of public goods.\nSource:\nGlobal Solutions\nDate\n09 April 2020\nThe speech can be viewed on the Global Solutions website.\nLadies and Gentlemen. Now, in early April, as I am taping this message, one issue dominates politics and all spheres of public and economic activity.\nThe coronavirus pandemic is the biggest challenge for the global community in decades. It is up to all of us to help fight this outbreak, to protect ourselves and to protect others. Our most important goal is safeguarding people\xe2\x80\x99s health all over the world.\nWhile we are doing everything to slow the spread of the virus, managing the impact that lockdowns and disruptions are having on our lives and on the economy is also important. Germany has adopted measures on an unprecedented scale to safeguard our health system and to support our citizens and our businesses.\nIn this crisis, one simple truth has become absolutely clear: we \xe2\x80\x93 all of us \xe2\x80\x93 depend on each other. Narrow self-interest will not help us. Solidarity will.\nWe need to stand together \xe2\x80\x93 as a society and as a global community. Viruses don\xe2\x80\x99t discriminate by nationality or income. They attack all of humanity. International cooperation is essential in effectively managing this pandemic and its economic fallout.\nAnd when so much depends on the ability of states to take effective action, we must work to ensure fiscal firepower and robust national budgets \xe2\x80\x93 in all countries. We must not allow some to avoid contributing their fair share.\nThat is why it remains important \xe2\x80\x93 also in this time of crisis \xe2\x80\x93 that we put an end to profit shifting and tax avoidance.\nWe must put an end to the harmful race to the bottom on corporate tax rates. Only small countries can hope to gain something by undercutting the tax rates of their neighbours. This is not an option for larger economies. And it is certainly not an option for a fair world economy and society.\nWe need a global corporate taxation framework that is fit for a globalised economy. A framework that makes profit shifting to tax havens a thing of the past.\nWe have already taken steps in the right direction by implementing the OECD\xe2\x80\x99s action plan against Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, known as BEPS.\nBut we are not there yet. We do not yet have a set of rules that is truly fit for the digital economy.\nThis is where my proposal for a minimum global tax rate comes in. Last year, the G20 tasked the OECD with presenting, in 2020, a plan for a corporate tax reform. 137 nations and jurisdictions are currently working on this task within the OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS.\nThe negotiations are organised in two pillars, which we discuss and explore in parallel and with the same level of commitment.\nIn pillar 1, we discuss changes to the allocation of the right to tax that better reflect how and where value is added in the globalised and digital economy. This would \xe2\x80\x93 among other things \xe2\x80\x93 benefit developing and emerging countries \xe2\x80\x93 many of which are ill-equipped to cope with this global health crisis.\nIn pillar 2, we develop a plan for a global minimum corporate tax rate, largely based on a concept I proposed together with my French colleague Bruno Le Maire. A minimum tax rate would dramatically reduce profit shifting incentives for large companies. It would thereby also help to protect small and medium-sized enterprises against unfair competition.\nMinimum tax rates work and they are supported by many countries around the world \xe2\x80\x93 including the U.S. In fact, the United States has already introduced a form of minimum taxation \xe2\x80\x93 which is not called GILTI by accident.\nPut both pillars together, and there is real scope to build a smarter and fairer global corporate tax framework.\nAn agreement will strengthen national budgets and limit unfair tax evasion; it will strengthen businesses, too \xe2\x80\x93 by eliminating legal uncertainty and the threat of double taxation.\nAn agreement will prevent an escalation of trade conflicts that unilateral steps would cause.\nAnd an agreement will support the long-term economic recovery across the globe after Corona. We have to be successful.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nIn these difficult times many matters are taking a back seat to more immediate concerns. But we must do our best to not let important issues slide.\nIt is encouraging to see people at home, in businesses, or at universities come up with innovative ways to keep us going in this crisis. This year\xe2\x80\x99s digital global solution summit provides an example of this kind of flexibility. Now is not the time to stop discussing important global policy issues like minimum corporate taxation. It is \xe2\x80\x93 in fact \xe2\x80\x93 a time for more policy coordination and more partnership. And so: thank you for taking part in this discussion.\nSubject Logo\nArea Menu\nSpeeches, Interviews and Articles\n:\nPress Releases\nMedia Images\nMedia Contacts\nAdditional Information\nCit\xc2\xadi\xc2\xadzens\xe2\x80\x99 Di\xc2\xada\xc2\xadlogue on the Fu\xc2\xadture of Eu\xc2\xadrope\nMonthly report\nPrint this page\nReturn to top\nPage overview\nHome\nIs\xc2\xadsues\nPriority issues\nPublic Finances\nTaxation\nFinancial Markets\nEurope\nStamps\nAbout\nMinister and Senior Leadership\nDirectorates-General\nAdvisory Board\nEvents at the Ministry\nHistory\nVisitors' Service\nDirections\nRe\xc2\xadsources\nPublications\nLaws in English\nMultimedia\nLivestream\nPress\nSpeeches, Interviews and Articles\nPress Releases\nMedia Images\nMedia Contacts\nMetanavigation\nLe\xc2\xadgal No\xc2\xadtice\nPri\xc2\xadva\xc2\xadcy Pol\xc2\xadi\xc2\xadcy\n\xc2\xa9 Federal Ministry of Finance\nVisit the Federal Ministry of Finance on social media and share\nTwitter BMF (Opens\xc2\xa0new\xc2\xa0window)\nInstagram BMF (Opens\xc2\xa0new\xc2\xa0window)\n\xc3\xb6ffnet den YouTube-Kanal des BMF.

To this end, on 23 March 2020, the federal cabinet adopted a draft text for the governing coalition parties. This will enable the German Bundestag to submit legislation establishing the fund.\nWe are doing our utmost to stem this unprecedented crisis. The Fund gives us the financial capacity we need to protect the economy, jobs and large German companies. The Fund allows for large-scale assistance on top of the KfW\xe2\x80\x99s loan programme, which has already been adopted. This includes state guarantees as well as the option to acquire temporary public holdings in businesses.German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz\nThe instruments of the Economic Stabilisation Fund comprise:\nA guarantee framework of \xe2\x82\xac400bn to help businesses find refinancing on the capital marketRecapitalisation measures totalling \xe2\x82\xac100bn to increase capital and ensure businesses remain solventLoans of up to \xe2\x82\xac100bn to refinance the KfW\xe2\x80\x99s special programmes\nAccess to these instruments will be given to businesses which fulfil the following criteria:\nBalance sheet total exceeds \xe2\x82\xac43mSales revenue exceeds \xe2\x82\xac50mAnnual average of more than 249 employees\nTo make sure that as many businesses as possible can access these instruments, the group of eligible beneficiaries will be expanded beyond the European Commission\xe2\x80\x99s definition of small and medium-sized businesses. Furthermore, access will also be granted to smaller businesses that are particularly important for infrastructure.\nThe Economic Stabilisation Fund will initially run until the end of 2021.\nTo finance these measures, the German government will take out additional funds on the capital market as and when needed, using its established, reliable market access via the German Finance Agency.\nRecapitalisation measures may be subject to specific conditions; specifically, these conditions may concern the remuneration of management, the disbursement of dividends and the use of funds provided by the state.\nFinally, certain company law provisions will be adjusted to make sure that assistance is quick and unbureaucratic.\n23 March 2020\nFinancial markets\nFed\xc2\xader\xc2\xadal gov\xc2\xadern\xc2\xadment takes large-scale mea\xc2\xadsures to tack\xc2\xadle cri\xc2\xadsis fall\xc2\xadout\nGerman government adopts supplementary budget for 2020\nNumber\n5\nThe federal cabinet today adopted a draft supplementary budget for 2020 together with the legislation necessary to enact a supplementary budget (Nachtragshaushaltsgesetz 2020). With these new budgetary provisions, the government is launching a comprehensive package of measures to protect the health of the people living Germany as well as protecting employees and companies from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.\nWe are ready to do whatever it takes to protect the health of the people living in Germany, to protect jobs and businesses, and to protect our country. We are launching an unprecedented package of assistance measures to fight the crisis. The supplementary budget allows us to implement everything quickly and effectively and ensure that the money reaches those who need it now. We want to get past this crisis in good shape; together, we can achieve this.German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz\nWith the supplementary budget, the German government is taking decisive action to combat the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, in terms of the challenges it poses both to health and to the economy. The additional measures covered by the supplementary budget encompass total expenditure of approximately \xe2\x82\xac122.5bn.\nNevertheless, it must be assumed that GDP will decline significantly this year due to the pandemic. For this reason, the German government is expecting that tax revenue will be lower, with an estimated shortfall of \xe2\x82\xac33.5bn compared to the revenue originally expected when the 2020 budget was planned.\nThanks to the sound fiscal policy practised in recent years, the German government is now in a position to take decisive fiscal action. The pandemic confronts Germany with tremendous challenges. To cover the ensuing costs, Germany will have to borrow roughly \xe2\x82\xac156bn, thereby exceeding the upper limit on borrowing stipulated by Germany\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional debt rules by almost \xe2\x82\xac100bn. However, the German government regards this as an unusual emergency situation that makes it necessary to exceed the limit on borrowing, in line with the sixth sentence of Article 115\xc2\xa0(2) of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz). The final decision on this matter lies with the German Bundestag, where adoption of the budget changes will require approval by a majority of its members.\n2020 supplementary budget: overviewTarget 2020After supplementary budgetGovernment draft 2020 supplementary budgetin \xe2\x82\xacbnExpenditure362.0+122.5484.5Investment expenditure42.9+5.948.8Revenue362.0+122.5484.5Tax revenue325.0-33.5291.5Net borrowing-+156.0156.0\nBreakdown of the measures:\n\xe2\x82\xac50bn will be made available to support small businesses and self-employed persons. These funds are intended as a bridge for self-employed persons, small traders and small businesses whose economic survival would otherwise be at risk.Furthermore, there will be a total increase of roughly \xe2\x82\xac7.7bn in funding for unemployment benefit II (Arbeitslosengeld\xc2\xa0II) as well as the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to housing costs and basic income support for older people. This will ensure a basic standard of living for groups such as the self-employed.In order to stem the spread of the virus, the federal government is making an additional \xe2\x82\xac3.5 billion available for further measures including a) central procurement of personal protective equipment, b) funding for development of a vaccine and treatment, c) support services provided by the Federal Armed Forces, d) assistance for German and EU citizens abroad, and e) public outreach to keep the population informed.Furthermore, the supplementary budget also makes available another \xe2\x82\xac55bn that can be drawn down at short notice to finance further measures to stem the pandemic. This will enable Germany to respond flexibly and at short notice to the further developments and consequences of the pandemic.The German government is also beefing up its provisions by around \xe2\x82\xac5.9bn to cover any claims that may arise, in particular from the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic, in the area of guarantees and securities.\nIn addition, the German government has agreed to put up a protective shield for employees and businesses: This protective shield will, for example, allow for more flexible arrangements for compensating short-time work (Kurzarbeitergeld), tax measures such as optional deferments to improve liquidity for businesses, and new measures relating to the KfW and government guarantees. The government wants to ensure that the KfW has adequate funding for guarantee programmes; to do this, it will make the necessary guarantee volumes available to the KfW. The government has also made corresponding provisions for export guarantees. The supplementary budget increases the guarantee framework (roughly \xe2\x82\xac465bn) by approximately \xe2\x82\xac357bn, to around \xe2\x82\xac822bn.\nFurther details on the supplementary budget are available here:\nGesamt\xc3\xbcber\xc2\xadsicht zum Nach\xc2\xadtragshaushalt 2020\n[pdf,\xc2\xa0252KB]\n(in German)\n23 March 2020\nEconomy and Finances\nAd\xc2\xaddi\xc2\xadtion\xc2\xadal KfW Spe\xc2\xadcial Pro\xc2\xadgramme 2020 for the econ\xc2\xado\xc2\xadmy to be launched to\xc2\xadday\nThe new KfW Special Programme 2020 will be launched today. The programme is available to small and medium-sized enterprises as well as large enterprises, with no cap being put on the funds to be provided for it. The conditions for taking out loans have been improved even further. KfW will apply lower interest rates and a simplified risk assessment procedure for loans of up to \xe2\x82\xac3 million, which will bring additional relief to the economy. Furthermore, KfW will grant a higher rate of exemption from liability of up to 90 per cent for working capital and investments by small and medium-sized enterprises in order to make it easier for banks and savings banks to grant loans. The improved conditions are based upon the European Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Temporary Framework on state aid law, which came into force on 19 March 2020.\nIt is now important to help companies quickly and without red tape. An important element here is to provide access to liquidity. The improved financing conditions set out in the KfW Special Programme 2020 will help to significantly support the economy in this respect. Applications will be processed quickly and without undue bureaucracy. Payments will be made as quickly as possible because we know that, for many enterprises, every week counts.Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier\nWe are launching an unprecedented support programme to protect our country, our employees and our companies. Together with the KfW, we are ensuring that our companies remain solvent during this crisis. To this end, we are also deploying the great financial strength of our state. The federal government will provide the KfW with the necessary amount of guarantees for this.Federal Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz\nThe banks and KfW have prepared intensively for today. Never before have we been able to put a full programme together this quickly. The federal government will assume close to full liability and the loan margins are extremely low.Dr G\xc3\xbcnther Br\xc3\xa4unig, Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors at KfW\nThe KfW Special Programme 2020 will be implemented through the programmes \xe2\x80\x98KfW Entrepreneur Loan\xe2\x80\x99 (037/047) and \xe2\x80\x98ERP Universal Start-up Loan\xe2\x80\x99 (073/074/075/076), whose financing terms will be modified and significantly extended. In addition, the special programme \xe2\x80\x98Direct Participation in Syndicated Lending\xe2\x80\x99 (855) enables large syndicated loans to be granted, with KfW assuming part of the risks.\nThe programmes are available to enterprises that are temporarily faced with financing difficulties due to the coronavirus crisis. More specifically, this means that all companies that were not in financial difficulties on 31 December 2019 are eligible to apply for a loan. Funding will be provided for investments and working capital.\nApplications can be submitted via the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s main bank as of today. Payments will be made as soon as possible. Applications will be processed based on a simple and unbureaucratic procedure.\nFurther information can be found on the KfW website at https://www.kfw.de/KfW-Konzern/Newsroom/Aktuelles/KfW-Corona-Hilfe-Unternehmen.html.\nA fact sheet on the \xe2\x80\x98KfW Special Programme 2020\xe2\x80\x99 is available (in German)\n23 March 2020\nEconomy and Finances\nGer\xc2\xadman gov\xc2\xadern\xc2\xadment an\xc2\xadnounces \xe2\x82\xac50 bil\xc2\xadlion in emer\xc2\xadgen\xc2\xadcy aid for small busi\xc2\xadness\xc2\xades\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz and Economic Affairs Minister Peter Altmaier today unveiled a comprehensive package of additional measures, including up to \xe2\x82\xac50\xc2\xa0billion for small businesses, self-employed individuals, and members of the liberal professions.\nWe are ready to do everything it takes to help the economy. This includes lending a helping hand to micro businesses and self-employed individuals. This crisis is having a severe impact on them, and they need particular assistance from us. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the German government is now providing them with fast, efficient emergency aid. I want to make a crucial point: We are providing grants, not loans. Nothing has to be paid back. In this way, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking action to reach the people who urgently need our support right now.Finance Minister Scholz\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re not leaving anyone to fend for themselves. There must not and will not be any gaps in our solidarity. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re putting together an additional comprehensive package worth up to \xe2\x82\xac50 billion for self-employed individuals and micro businesses. These new measures include direct grants that do not have to be paid back. In addition, we are establishing an Economic Stabilisation Fund to give the real economy concrete support and to prevent a sell-out of German economic and industrial interests. There can be no taboos here.

Tax revenue (including transfers of EU own resources to the EU) was up by 10.7% (about \xe2\x82\xac4.3bn) on the year.\nOther revenue recorded a year-on-year gain of 26.3% (about \xe2\x82\xac0.8bn). This was primarily due to the administrative fines paid to the Federal Cartel Office; receipts from the distance-based commercial vehicle toll were higher on the year as well.\nReturn to top\nExpenditure\nFederal expenditure in the first two months of 2020 totalled approximately \xe2\x82\xac65.9bn, an increase of 1.5% (about \xe2\x82\xac1.0bn) over the same period last year. Federal spending is separated into consumption and investment spending. Consumption spending was up by 2.7% on the year in the first two months of 2020. Two key factors driving this trend were (a)\xc2\xa0grants for the permanent discontinuation of subsidised coal mining, which were due in 2020 and have now been fully disbursed (an increase of about \xe2\x82\xac1bn on the year) and (b)\xc2\xa0higher payments to social security funds (an increase of about \xe2\x82\xac0.9bn on the year). Interest expenditure was down on the year by 8.3%.\nInvestment spending stood at \xe2\x82\xac3.8bn after the first two months of 2020, a decline of 14.8% (or \xe2\x82\xac0.7bn) compared with the same period last year. This is attributable mainly to the discontinuation of compensation payments from the Federation to the L\xc3\xa4nder (the Federation and L\xc3\xa4nder agreed to end these payments as part of the reorganisation of financial relations between government levels that took effect at the start of 2020). Instead of receiving compensation payments, the L\xc3\xa4nder now receive a higher share of VAT revenue. Construction investment was up on the year by about \xe2\x82\xac0.3bn, or 44.7%.\nReturn to top\nFiscal balance\nThe federal budget recorded a deficit of \xe2\x82\xac18.3bn for the January\xe2\x80\x93February 2020 period.\nRevenue and expenditure are subject to strong fluctuations over the course of the fiscal year and thus have an uneven effect on cash funds in individual months. Net borrowing also tends to fluctuate considerably over the course of the year. This means that the fiscal balance at any given point in the year and the corresponding net borrowing figures are not reliable indicators of the end-of-year figures for the fiscal balance and net borrowing.\nReturn to top\nTrends in federal expenditure by function\nTrends in federal expenditure by function\nTrends in federal expenditure by function\nActual 2019\n2020

This positive trend was driven by another significant year-on-year increase in receipts from joint taxes (up by 5.7%), as wages tax and value added taxes posted major revenue growth on the year. Corporation tax and assessed income tax also recorded gains as a result of assessments from previous years. As in January, the yield from withholding tax on interest and capital gains also saw major growth. In contrast, revenue from non-assessed taxes on earnings was down sharply on the year. The yield from taxes accruing solely to the Federation rose significantly on the year. Revenue from taxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder surged by 13.5%.\nReturn to top\nEU own resources\nTransfers of own resources to the EU, including customs duties, totalled approximately \xe2\x82\xac3.1bn in February 2020, a year-on-year decline of 50.7%. In January, the European Commission had already drawn down an additional twelfth of the amount earmarked for the entire year, for the purpose of financing its functions. In February, the Commission drew down a significantly lower amount of VAT and GNI-based own resources compared with February 2019. Monthly fluctuations occur over the course of the year based on the EU\xe2\x80\x99s financing needs at any given time. However, monthly requisitions are generally in line with the financial framework for the current year.\nReturn to top\nCumulative overview of the January\xe2\x80\x93February 2020 period\nTax revenue increased by 7.1% overall in the first two months of 2020. This upward trend was reflected in receipts from joint taxes (up by 6.5%), taxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder (up by 11.8%), and taxes accruing to the Federation (up by 9.8%).\nReturn to top\nDistribution among the Federation, L\xc3\xa4nder and local authorities\nThe Federation\xe2\x80\x99s overall tax revenue (after accounting for supplementary federal grants to the L\xc3\xa4nder) was up significantly in February 2020 over the same month last year, by 21.9%. One factor here was the marked year-on-year gain that the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s tax receipts recorded in February. For example, revenue from purely federal taxes was up by 9.8%. In addition, the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s share of joint taxes also recorded a solid increase of 3.8%, thanks to high receipts from joint taxes. However, the reorganisation of the fiscal equalisation system, which came into effect on 1\xc2\xa0January\xc2\xa02020, changed the distribution of VAT revenue to the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantage. This tempered year-on-year growth in the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s share of VAT revenue, which rose by only 2.1% in February. In addition, supplementary federal grants to the L\xc3\xa4nder were markedly higher on the year in February 2020. However, the main explanatory factor for the high growth rate in February is not the increase in tax revenue, but rather the sharp year-on-year decline in transfers of own resources from the federal budget to the European Union in February.\nL\xc3\xa4nder tax receipts were up by 8.0% on the year in February\xc2\xa02020. This was due mainly to higher yields from the share of joint taxes allocated to the L\xc3\xa4nder, which were up by 7.3% on the year. Receipts from taxes that accrue only to the L\xc3\xa4nder were also up sharply on the year in February, by 13.5%. Local authorities\xe2\x80\x99 take from their share of joint taxes was 7.0% higher than in February\xc2\xa02019.\nReturn to top\nJoint taxes\nReturn to top\nWages tax\nWages tax receipts continued to grow in February\xc2\xa02020, with gross revenue increasing by 4.9% on the year. Child benefit payments, which are financed from wages tax receipts, rose by 4.0% on the year due to a \xe2\x82\xac10 per child increase in monthly child benefit that came into effect in July\xc2\xa02019. On balance, cash receipts from wages tax increased by 5.4% on the year in February\xc2\xa02020 and by 4.9% on the year in cumulative terms over the first two months of 2020.\nReturn to top\nCorporation tax\nGross revenue from corporation tax was approximately \xe2\x82\xac11m in February, a month when revenue from this tax tends to be low. In February of 2019, refunds of corporation tax totalled approximately \xe2\x82\xac32m. Taxpayer refunds of investment allowance slightly exceeded payouts in February. However, this had only a negligible impact on results. On balance, cash receipts from corporation tax stood at roughly \xe2\x82\xac11m in February 2020. In cumulative terms, cash receipts from corporation tax rose to approximately \xe2\x82\xac1.1bn in the first two months of 2020.\nReturn to top\nAssessed income tax\nGross receipts from assessed income tax posted a substantial year-on-year increase of 9.9% in February\xc2\xa02020. Employee refunds were down by 12.8% on the year in February; after these are subtracted from the gross figure (along with investment allowance payments and owner-occupied homes premiums, which are insignificant in terms of amount), net cash receipts from assessed income tax increased by 47.5% in February\xc2\xa02020 over the same period in 2019. In cumulative terms, cash receipts from assessed income tax were up by 47.0% on the year in the January\xe2\x80\x93February 2020 period.\nReturn to top\nNon-assessed taxes on earnings\nFebruary 2020 saw an 18.9% year-on-year decline in gross receipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings. Refunds by the Federal Central Tax Office, which are financed from this revenue, fell by 21.6% to approximately\xc2\xa0\xe2\x82\xac84m. As a result, cash receipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings were down by 18.6% on the year. Cumulative cash receipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings in January and February 2020 were up by 10.3% on the year.\nReturn to top\nFinal withholding tax on interest and capital gains\nRevenue from final withholding tax on interest and capital gains climbed by 32.9% on the year in February\xc2\xa02020. There are no statistics breaking down this figure into its two components, but it can be assumed that the rise is attributable to the contribution made by capital gains. In cumulative terms, cash receipts from withholding tax on interest and capital gains were up by 38.0% on the year in the January\xe2\x80\x93February 2020 period.\nReturn to top\nValue added taxes\nReceipts from value added taxes were up by 5.1% on the year in February 2020. Receipts from domestic VAT rose substantially by 7.3% on the year, while import VAT revenue fell by 2.3%. Cumulative cash receipts from value added taxes were up by 3.2% on the year in the first two months of 2020.\nReturn to top\nFederal taxes\nIn February\xc2\xa02020, revenue from taxes accruing solely to the Federation was up by 9.8% over the same month last year. Insurance tax posted particularly noticeable revenue growth of 16.7% on the year. Insurance tax receipts had declined markedly in February 2019, because some of the revenue from that month was not reflected in cash receipts until March 2019. Energy duty revenue also posted a strong gain of 10.6%. Receipts from the solidarity surcharge climbed by 5.7% on the year thanks to growth in revenues from income and corporation tax (which constitute its tax base). Revenue gains were also recorded for electricity duty (up by 11.7%), alcohol duty (up by 2.3%) and aviation tax (up by 5.5%). In contrast, tobacco duty revenue was down on the year by 4.9% in February. Receipts also fell for coffee duty (down by 2.6%) and sparkling wine duty (down by\xc2\xa08.7%). Trends in revenue from other taxes had only a minor impact on the overall results for federal taxes.\nReturn to top\nTaxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder\nRevenue from taxes accruing solely to the L\xc3\xa4nder increased again significantly in February\xc2\xa02020, by 13.5% on the year. This was mainly due to substantial growth in revenue from real property transfer tax (up by 16.4%) and inheritance tax (up by 9.8%). The yield from fire protection tax increased by 6.0%, while receipts from betting and lottery tax were up by 7.8%. Revenue from beer duty was up as well, by 3.7%.\nReturn to top\nBorrowing and guarantees\nDebt trends for the Federation and its special funds (in \xe2\x82\xacm)\nDebt trends for the Federation and its special funds (in \xe2\x82\xacm)\nDebt level\nBorrowing\n(increase)\nDebt repayment\n(decrease)\nDebt level\nChange in debt level\n(balance)\n31 January 2020\nFebruary 2020\nFebruary 2020\n28 February 2020\nFebruary 2020\nBudget borrowing\n1,060,267\n17,535\n-7,096\n1,070,707\n10,439\nbroken down by purpose\nFederal budget\n1,018,388\n17,535\n-7,096\n1,028,827\n10,439\nFinancial Market Stabilisation Fund (loans for expenses pursuant to section 9 (1) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act (Finanzmarkstabilisierungsfondsgesetz)\n22,680\n-\n-\n22,680\n-\nInvestment and Redemption Fund\n19,200\n0\n-\n19,200\n0\nFinancial Market Stabilisation Fund (loans for resolution authorities pursuant to section 9 (5) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act)1\n26,500\n1,500\n-\n28,000\n1,500\nTotal including loans for resolution authorities1\n1,086,767\n19,035\n-7,096\n1,098,707\n11,939\nbroken down by debt type\nFederal securities\n1,075,499\n19,035\n-7,026\n1,087,508\n12,009\nConventional federal securities\n1,004,786\n18,600\n-7,026\n1,016,359\n11,574\n30-year federal bonds\n231,918\n1,347\n-\n233,265\n1,347\n10-year federal bonds\n478,486\n3,723\n-\n482,209\n3,723\nFederal notes\n178,262\n3,451\n-\n181,713\n3,451\nFederal Treasury notes\n94,549\n5,566\n-\n100,115\n5,566\nTreasury discount papers issued by the Federation\n21,570\n4,513\n-7,026\n19,058\n-2,513\nInflation-linked federal securities\n70,308\n436\n-\n70,744\n436\n30-year inflation-linked federal bonds\n8,548\n196\n-\n8,744\n196\n10-year inflation-linked federal bonds\n61,760\n240\n-\n61,999\n240\nOther federal securities\n405\n-\n-\n405\n-\nSecuritised loans\n6,795\n-\n-70\n6,725\n-70\nOther loans and ordinary debts\n4,474\n-\n-\n4,474\n-\nbroken down by maturity\nup to one year\n176,127\n174,613\n-1,513\none to four years\n320,656\n342,992\n22,336\nmore than 4 years\n589,985\n581,101\n-8,884\nAdditional information1\nLiabilities from the indexing of inflation-linked federal securities2\n5,795\n6,052\n257\nReserves in accordance with the Final Payment Financing Act\n(Schlusszahlungsfinanzierungsgesetz)3\n4,573\n4,593\n20\n1Under section 9 (5) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act, the Federal Ministry of Finance is empowered to borrow up to \xe2\x82\xac30bn for the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund so that the Fund can grant loans to resolution authorities for the purpose of refinancing (as per section 8 (10) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act) assets that they have taken over.

This discussion followed up on the video conference of 10 March 2020 between European Council members, the ECB President, the Eurogroup President and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.\nThe Eurogroup expressed its sympathy and solidarity with the citizens and the Member States particularly hit by this crisis and its gratitude to those risking their own health to save lives. The Eurogroup is following the situation very closely and is in permanent contact and coordinated to give a strong economic policy response to the exceptional situation. Our commitments of today reflect our strong determination to do whatever it takes to effectively address the current challenges and to restore confidence and support a rapid recovery.\nToday, we welcomed all the measures taken by Member States and by the European Commission, in particular those taken to ensure that health systems and civil protection systems are adequately provided for to contain and treat the disease, preserve the wellbeing of our citizens and help firms and workers that are particularly affected.\nFacing these exceptional circumstances, we agreed that an immediate, ambitious and co-ordinated policy response is needed. We have decided to act and will respond swiftly and flexibly to developments as they unfold. We will make use of all instruments necessary to limit the socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak. We have therefore put together a first set of national and European measures while setting a framework for further actions to respond to developments and to support the economic recovery. Preliminary estimates of the European Commission show that total fiscal support to the economy will be very sizeable. We have, so far, decided fiscal measures of about 1% of GDP, on average, for 2020 to support the economy, in addition to the impact of automatic stabilisers, which should work fully. We have, so far, committed to provide liquidity facilities of at least 10% of GDP, consisting of public guarantee schemes and deferred tax payments. These figures could be much larger going forward.\nThe following measures are part of our co-ordinated responses to protect our economies.\nAll national authorities will allow automatic stabilisers to function and in addition implement all necessary measures to ensure that the economic consequences of COVID-19 are tackled and that they do not put in danger our economic and social achievements. To the extent required by the evolving situation in each country, they will implement temporary measures such as:\nImmediate fiscal spending targeted at containment and treatment of the disease. Adequate resources will be provided to our health sectors and civil protection systems;Liquidity support for firms facing severe disruption and liquidity shortages, especially SMEs and firms in severely affected sectors and regions, including transport and tourism \xe2\x80\x93 this can include tax measures, public guarantees to help companies to borrow, export guarantees and waiving of delay penalties in public procurement contracts;Support for affected workers to avoid employment and income losses, including short-term work support, extension of sick pay and unemployment benefits and deferral of income tax payments.\n2. Coordinated efforts at the European level will supplement national measures:\nWe welcome the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for a \xe2\x82\xac37 billion \xe2\x80\x9cCorona Response Investment Initiative\xe2\x80\x9d directed at health care systems, SMEs, labour markets and other vulnerable parts of our economies, and to make a further \xe2\x82\xac28 billion of structural funds fully eligible for meeting these expenditures. We agreed on the need to implement the necessary legislative changes as quickly as possible;We welcome the initiative of the Commission and the EIB Group to mobilise up to \xe2\x82\xac8 billion of working capital lending for 100,000 European firms, backed by the EU budget, by enhancing programmes for guaranteeing bank credits to SMEs. We also support the ongoing efforts of the Commission and the EIB Group to increase this amount to up to \xe2\x82\xac20 billion, which would reach a further 150,000 firms. We also welcome the ongoing work to make further funds available as swiftly as possible and to enhance the flexibility of the financial instruments leveraged;We welcome the initiative of the EIB Group to catalyse \xe2\x82\xac10 billion in additional investments in SMEs and midcaps for their own account and to accelerate the deployment of another \xe2\x82\xac10 billion backed by the EU budget;We invite the EIB to further enhance and accelerate the impact of the available resources, including through enhanced collaboration with the National Development Banks;We also welcomed the package of monetary policy measures taken by the ECB last week aimed at supporting liquidity and funding conditions for households, businesses and banks, help the smooth provision of credit to the real economy, and avoid fragmentation of euro area financial markets in order to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy.\n3. Beyond the immediate, targeted response, we are working on all the necessary measures, to help the economy recover once the coronavirus has receded. We acknowledge the need to reflect on the resilience of our European strategic value chains to better protect Europe from product and capital market disruptions in the future. We have already significantly strengthened our crisis management framework, including with the establishment of the ESM. Today we recommit to continue our work to further strengthen the architecture and resilience to shocks of the Economic and Monetary Union.\nOur shared rules will support this response. In particular, we discussed the application of the SGP, state aid rules and prudential rules:\nThe economic shock of the coronavirus, with an economic contraction now expected this year, together with the cost of our agreed measures, will have a substantial budgetary impact. The SGP has the flexibility needed to cater for this situation and we will make full use of this flexibility in all member states.Automatic stabilisers will fully play their role. This means that automatic revenue shortfalls and unemployment benefit increases resulting from the drop in economic activity will not affect compliance with the applicable fiscal rules, targets and requirements. In addition, we agreed that the budgetary effects of temporary fiscal measures taken in response to COVID-19 will be excluded when assessing compliance with the EU fiscal rules, targets and requirements. This includes the budgetary impact of temporary and targeted measures, such as those urgently needed to contain and treat the pandemic, ensure liquidity support to firms and sectors, and protect jobs and incomes of affected workers. The flexibility to cater for unusual events outside the control of government is applicable to the current situation. We welcome the readiness of the Commission to activate the general escape clause, allowing for further discretionary stimulus, while preserving medium-term sustainability.We welcomed the Commission guidance on the scope for supporting firms that is available within state aid rules in the current circumstances, together with the Commission announcement that it has accelerated its state aid approval processes. The Commission has announced it will approve additional measures needed to remedy this serious disturbance in the economy, which is already the case for Italy and increasingly across the EU. Taking urgent action and making full use of the flexibility foreseen in the state aid rules is necessary to cushion the effect of the crisis for those companies and sectors which are affected, whilst ensuring a consistent framework and a level playing field in the single market. The Commission stands ready to issue a specific framework shortly.The banking system has a key role in preventing this health emergency from turning into a social and economic crisis for businesses and households. We therefore welcomed the statement by the European Banking Authority that competent authorities should make full use, where appropriate, of the flexibility embedded in existing regulation to support the banking sector in view of the current exceptional circumstances.In particular, we also welcomed the decisions taken by ECB Banking Supervision providing temporary capital and operational relief to euro area banks, with a view to ensuring that supervised banks can continue to fulfil their role in funding the real economy as the economic effects of the coronavirus become apparent. Such flexibility is needed to avoid, as much as possible, pro-cyclical, unintended consequences for the financial sector.\nWe will take whatever further coordinated and decisive policy action is necessary, including fiscal measures, to support growth and employment.\nMore on this topic\nOut\xc2\xadcomes of the Eu\xc2\xadrogroup meet\xc2\xading on 16 March 2020\n17 March 2020\nA pro\xc2\xadtec\xc2\xadtive shield for em\xc2\xadploy\xc2\xadees and com\xc2\xadpa\xc2\xadnies\nOn 13 March 2020, Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Finance Ministry and Economic Affairs Ministry jointly unveiled an assistance programme and tax policy measures totalling billions of euros. The two ministries agreed on an extensive package of measures to protect jobs and to protect businesses of all sizes in all sectors. The aim is to ensure that Germany\xe2\x80\x99s health care system and economy are financially equipped to manage the epidemic.\nPackage of measures to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus\nThe German government is taking decisive and forceful action against the economic impact of the coronavirus. Federal Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) and Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier (CDU) have agreed on a farreaching package of measures to protect jobs and support companies. The government is setting up a protective shield for employees and companies. The goal is to equip businesses with sufficient liquidity that they will be able to make it through the crisis in good shape.\nThe government\xe2\x80\x99s central message is that there is enough money available to tackle the crisis and it is going to use this money now. We will take all the necessary measures. That is something everyone can rely on.\nContext\nThe coronavirus is a serious challenge for our whole society. Not only citizens but also companies are becoming increasingly concerned. Due to the economy\xe2\x80\x99s close international ties, German companies are also affected by the impact of the pandemic in other parts of the world. It is not yet possible to accurately identify the effects that the pandemic will have on the German economy, because meaningful economic indicators will not be available until later, due to their inherent time lag. Nevertheless, many companies are already feeling the initial impact of the virus. Cancellations of trade fairs and large-scale events, and the decline in travel, are affecting the service sector, especially in the areas of logistics, trade, gastronomy and tourism. At the same time, foreign demand is dropping and international supply chains are being disrupted, which impacts production in Germany.\nThe German government is confronting these problems with decisive economic and fiscal policy measures. Ministers Scholz and Altmaier will make liquidity available to businesses, thus securing growth and employment.\nThe conditions are in place to swiftly stabilise the German economy. Targeted, fastacting measures will immediately be taken to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus, in order to bring the economy back onto a growth path as quickly as possible. This is happening in close coordination with the German L\xc3\xa4nder and with our European and international partners.\nThe Federal Ministry of Health has already been swiftly provided with around \xe2\x82\xac1 billion to fight the coronavirus, including for the procurement of protective equipment such as face masks and protective suits, support for the WHO in the international fight against the coronavirus, and the provision of additional funds for the Robert Koch Institute, Germany\xe2\x80\x99s leading public health institution. In addition, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research has received \xe2\x82\xac145 million to develop a vaccine and for treatment-related measures.\nA protective shield for employees and companies\nThe government is creating a protective shield for employees and companies who are affected by the impact of the coronavirus. It consists of four pillars:\n1. Making reduced hours compensation benefit (Kurzarbeitergeld) more flexible\nGermany has a strong social security system. The automatic stabilisers that are part of this system support the economy. The German government will ensure that these stabilisers take full effect. Uncertainly and short-term disruptions to trade flows cannot be allowed to cause people to lose their jobs. In this respect, the government can take advantage of tried-and-tested tools. By the beginning of April, the rules on reduced hours compensation benefit will be adapted to suit current needs. As part of this, eligibility requirements will be loosened:\nReduction of the minimum ratio of the employees in a company affected by shorter working hours to 10%Partial or complete waiver of the need to build up a negative balance in working hoursReduced hours compensation benefit will also be available to temporary/agency workersComplete reimbursement of social security contributions by the Federal Labour Office\n2. Tax-related liquidity assistance for businesses\nIn order to improve companies\xe2\x80\x99 liquidity situation, the options for deferring tax payments and reducing prepayments will be enhanced, and enforcement rules will be adapted. Overall, businesses will be able to defer billions of euros in tax payments. The Federal Ministry of Finance has already initiated the necessary coordination process with the L\xc3\xa4nder. The measures are described in detail below:\nIt will be easier to grant tax deferrals. Revenue authorities will be able to defer taxes if their collection would lead to significant hardship. The revenue authorities will be instructed to not impose strict conditions in this respect. This will support taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 liquidity, because the timing of tax payments will be delayed.It will be easier to adapt tax prepayments. As soon as it becomes clear that a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s income in the current year is expected to be lower than in the previous year, tax prepayments will be reduced in a swift and straightforward manner. This will improve the liquidity situation.Enforcement measures (e.g. attachment of bank accounts) and late-payment penalties will be waived until 31 December 2020 if the debtor of a pending tax payment is directly affected by the coronavirus.\nWith regard to taxes that are administered by the customs administration (e.g. energy duty and aviation tax), the Central Customs Authority (Generalzolldirektion) has been instructed to make appropriate concessions to taxpayers. The same applies to the Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt f\xc3\xbcr Steuern), which will proceed accordingly with regard to insurance tax and value added tax, which fall within its remit.\n3. A protective shield worth billions for businesses\nMany businesses are currently suffering from declines in turnover that are not their fault, either because of disruptions to supply chains or significant drops in demand in many sectors of the German economy. At the same time, operating costs often cannot be reduced, or can be reduced only slowly. This can lead to a situation where healthy companies land in financial difficulties through no fault of their own, particularly with regard to their liquidity. The German government will protect businesses with new measures to provide liquidity, the volume of which is unlimited. Due to the high degree of uncertainty in the current situation, the government has very deliberately decided to not set any limits on the volume of these measures. This is a very significant decision which is supported by the entire federal government.\nIn a first step, existing liquidity assistance programmes will be expanded to make it easier for companies to access cheap loans. This can mobilise a large volume of liquidity-enhancing loans from commercial banks. To this end, our established instruments complementing loans offered by private banks will be extended and made available to a greater number of companies:\nConditions for the KfW-Unternehmerkredit (business loan for existing companies) and the ERP-Gr\xc3\xbcnderkredit-Universell (start-up loan for companies that are less than 5 years old) will be loosened by raising the level of risk assumptions (indemnity) for operating loans and extending these instruments to large enterprises with a turnover of up to \xe2\x82\xac2 billion (previously, the limit was \xe2\x82\xac500 million). Higher risk assumptions of up to 80% for operating loans of up to \xe2\x82\xac200 million will increase banks\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to extend credit.In the case of the \xe2\x80\x9cKfW Loan for Growth\xe2\x80\x9d, the programme aimed at larger companies, the current turnover threshold of \xe2\x82\xac2 billion will be raised to \xe2\x82\xac5 billion. In future, these loans will take the form of syndicated loans and will not be restricted to projects in one particular field (in the past, only innovation and digitalisation projects were eligible). Risk assumption will be increased to up to 70% (from 50%). This will improve larger companies\xe2\x80\x99 access to syndicated loans.For companies with a turnover of more than \xe2\x82\xac5 billion, support will continue to be provided on a case-by-case basis.\nFor guarantee banks (B\xc3\xbcrgschaftsbanken), the guarantee limit will be doubled, to \xe2\x82\xac2.5 million. The Federation will increase its risk share in guarantee banks by 10% to make it easier to shoulder risks, which are difficult to assess in times of crisis. The upper limit of 35% of operating resources in guarantee banks\xe2\x80\x99 total exposure will be increased to 50%. To accelerate liquidity provision, the Federation is giving guarantee banks the freedom to make guarantee decisions up to \xe2\x82\xac250,000 independently and within a period of three days.\nThe large guarantee programme (parallel guarantees from the Federation and the L\xc3\xa4nder), which was previously limited to companies in structurally weak regions, will be opened up to companies in other regions, as well. In this programme, the Federation covers operating loans and investments with a surety requirement upwards of \xe2\x82\xac50 million and a guarantee rate of up to 80%.\nWe are in close contact with the L\xc3\xa4nder development banks and the guarantee banks.\nThese measures are covered by existing state aid rules.\nFor companies that have temporarily got into serious financial difficulties because of the crisis and therefore do not have easy access to existing support programmes, we will launch additional special KfW programmes. This will be achieved by increasing the KfW\xe2\x80\x99s risk tolerance in a way that is appropriate given the crisis. Risk assumptions for investment funds (indemnity) will be improved significantly and will total up to 80% in the case of operating resources and up to 90% in the case of investments. In addition, consortium structures will be offered for these companies.\nThese special programmes are now being submitted to the European Commission for approval. The Commission President has already indicated that, in light of the coronavirus crisis, she will ensure that state aid rules are applied in a flexible way. The EU and Eurogroup finance ministers will advocate the necessary flexibility on the part of the European Commission.\nThe German government will put the KfW in a position to fund these programmes by making the necessary guarantee volumes available. This is not a problem, because the federal budget includes a guarantee framework of approximately \xe2\x82\xac460 billion. If necessary, this can be increased by up to \xe2\x82\xac93 billion at short notice.\nWith its export credit guarantees (known as Hermes covers), the Federation offers companies flexible, effective and comprehensive support that is sufficient for managing serious situations comparable to the years following the 2009 financial crisis. These instruments proved their worth at the time, and the funds available in the 2020 budget are sufficient for a similar increase in the funding volume. This is supported by a wellequipped KfW programme for the refinancing of export business. If there is a need for additional export cover and refinancing, the authorised amount can be increased very quickly.\n4. Strengthening European cohesion\nAt the European level, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and German Economic Affairs Minister Peter Altmaier are advocating coordinated and decisive action. Germany is well aware of its responsibility to Europe. In close consultation with its European partners, the German government will dovetail its coronavirus response with those of other countries.\nThe German government welcomes the European Commission\xe2\x80\x99s idea of a Corona Response Investment Initiative with a volume of \xe2\x82\xac25 billion.\nIt also welcomes ECB banking supervision\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that it will utilise existing leeway to ensure that banks can continue to fulfil their role in funding the real economy, as well as the measures for providing liquidity to banks that were announced by the ECB on Wednesday.\nIt is good that the EIB Group is supporting companies across Europe that are experiencing liquidity shortfalls due to the coronavirus, using instruments that proved their worth during past crises. In particular, the EIF\xe2\x80\x99s well-established portfolio guarantees to safeguard companies\xe2\x80\x99 liquidity should be used.\nOutlook\nAll these measures show that the German government is committed to countering the effects of the coronavirus with economic and fiscal policy stimuli in order to protect companies and their employees and mitigate the impact of the crisis. The full economic effects of the crisis cannot be predicted at this stage. If there are any signs of a serious disruption to the economy, the German government, in consultation with the L\xc3\xa4nder and with our European partners, will use all resources available to counter this forcefully.\nThe German state is well prepared for such a scenario: thanks to the general government surpluses generated in recent years, it is in a position to boost the economy over a sustained period and bring it back to its previous growth path.\nDownload\nA pro\xc2\xadtec\xc2\xadtive shield for em\xc2\xadploy\xc2\xadees and com\xc2\xadpa\xc2\xadnies\n[pdf,\xc2\xa0613KB]\n21 February 2020\nOverview of fed\xc2\xader\xc2\xadal bud\xc2\xadgetary and fi\xc2\xadnan\xc2\xadcial da\xc2\xadta up to and in\xc2\xadclud\xc2\xading Jan\xc2\xaduary 2020\nTranslated extracts from the Federal Ministry of Finance\xe2\x80\x99s February 2020 monthly report.\nFederal budget trends up to and including January\xc2\xa02020\nTrends in federal expenditure by function\nTrends in federal expenditure by economic category\nTrends in federal revenue\nTax revenue in January 2020\nBorrowing and guarantees\nCalendar\nFederal budget trends up to and including January\xc2\xa02020\nTable: Trends in the federal budget\nExpenditure (\xe2\x82\xacbn)2\n343.2\n362.0\n40.5\nYear-on-year change in % (year to date)\n+0.3\nRevenue (\xe2\x82\xacbn)3\n356.5\n351.0\n20.5\nYear-on-year change in % (year to date)\n-1.2\nTax revenue (\xe2\x82\xacbn)\n329.0\n325.0\n18.2\nYear-on-year change in % (year to date)\n-4.7\nBalance of pass-through funds (\xe2\x82\xacbn)\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nFiscal balance (\xe2\x82\xacbn)\n13.3\n-11.0\n-20.0\nFinancing/use of surplus:\n-13.3\n11.0\n20.0\nCash resources (\xe2\x82\xacbn)\n-\n-\n79.5\nSeigniorage (\xe2\x82\xacbn)\n0.2\n0.3\n0.0\nMovements in reserves4 (\xe2\x82\xacbn)\n-13.5\n10.6\n0.0\nNet borrowing5 (\xe2\x82\xacbn)\n0.0\n0.0\n-59.5\nAny discrepancies in totals are due to rounding.\n1As per accounts.\n2With the exception of expenditure on the repayment of debt incurred on the credit market, allocations to reserves and expenditure made to cover a cash deficit.

Tax revenue (including transfers of EU own resources to the EU) declined by 4.7% (\xe2\x82\xac0.9bn), mainly due to the fact that Germany transferred approximately \xe2\x82\xac2.0bn more in GNI-based resources to the EU than it did in the same month last year.\nOther revenue was 39.5% (\xe2\x82\xac0.6bn) higher than in January 2019. This was primarily due to the administrative fines paid to the Federal Cartel Office in January.\nReturn to top\nExpenditure\nFederal expenditure in January 2020 totalled \xe2\x82\xac40.5bn, up by 0.3% (\xe2\x82\xac0.1bn) on the year. Federal spending is separated into consumption and investment spending. Consumption spending was 2.4% higher in January 2020 than in the same month of 2019. A key contributing factor were the grants for the phase-out of subsidised coal mining (up by \xe2\x82\xac1.0bn), which fell due in January.\nOngoing grants to public administrations were roughly \xe2\x82\xac399m lower than in January 2019. This is partly because, as of 1\xc2\xa0January\xc2\xa02020, the Federation no longer needs to pay compensation payments to the L\xc3\xa4nder in relation to the phasing-out of federal assistance for the promotion of social housing. This will reduce the total level of federal grants to public administrations by \xe2\x82\xac1.5bn in 2020.\nInterest expenditure in January 2020 saw a sharp year-on-year decline of 13.2%. Investment spending by the end of January 2020 stood at \xe2\x82\xac2.5bn, a significant year-on-year decline of 22.8%. This is partly attributable to the discontinuation of compensation payments to the L\xc3\xa4nder, but also to the fact that planned investment grants and subsidies had not yet been drawn down in January.\nReturn to top\nFiscal balance\nThe federal budget recorded a deficit of \xe2\x82\xac20.0bn for January 2020.\nRevenue and expenditure are subject to strong fluctuations over the course of the fiscal year and thus have an uneven effect on cash funds in individual months. Net borrowing also tends to fluctuate considerably over the course of the year. This means that the fiscal balance at any given point in the year and the corresponding net borrowing figures are not reliable indicators of the end-of-year figures for the fiscal balance and net borrowing.\nThis is especially true towards the start of the year.\nReturn to top\nTrends in federal expenditure by function\nTrends in federal expenditure by function\nTrends in federal expenditure

This was driven by significantly higher receipts from joint taxes (up by 7.3%). Corporation tax and assessed income tax posted particularly high revenue growth. The yield from final withholding tax on interest and capital gains and from non-assessed taxes on earnings was also significantly higher than in January 2019. The revenue from wages tax increased, as well. In contrast, receipts from value added taxes posted only moderate growth. The yield from taxes accruing solely to the Federation rose significantly on the year. Revenue from taxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder surged by 10.3%.\nReturn to top\nEU own resources\nTransfers of own resources to the EU, including customs duties, totalled approximately \xe2\x82\xac4.8bn in January 2020, a year-on-year increase of 92.1%. To finance its tasks, the European Commission drew down an additional twelfth of the amount earmarked for the entire year in January 2020. In other words, two twelfths of the annual amount were transferred in January 2020, resulting in a significant year-on-year rise in transfers of BNI-based and VAT-based own resources to the EU. Monthly fluctuations occur over the course of the year based on the EU\xe2\x80\x99s financing needs at any given time.\nReturn to top\nDistribution among the Federation, L\xc3\xa4nder and local authorities\nThe Federation\xe2\x80\x99s tax receipts (after accounting for supplementary federal grants to the L\xc3\xa4nder) posted a significant year-on-year decline of 4.9% in January 2020. On the face of it, the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s tax receipts increased significantly. Revenue from taxes accruing solely to the Federation was up by 10.2% on the year, and the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s share of joint taxes also recorded a significant rise of 5.4%, thanks to the high receipts from joint taxes. However, the reorganisation of the fiscal equalisation system, which came into effect on 1 January 2020, changed the distribution of VAT revenue to the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantage. As a result, the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s share of VAT revenue declined by 2.9%, and the Federation also had to pay significantly higher supplementary federal grants to the L\xc3\xa4nder in January 2020. Moreover, transfers of own resources to the EU were also considerably higher in January 2020 than in the same month last year.\nL\xc3\xa4nder tax receipts were up by 9.3% on the year in January 2020. This was due mainly to higher yields from the share of joint taxes allocated to the L\xc3\xa4nder, which were up by 9.2% on the year. Receipts from taxes that accrue only to the L\xc3\xa4nder were also up markedly on the year in January, by 10.3%. Local authorities\xe2\x80\x99 take from their share of joint taxes was 7.3% higher than in January 2019.\nReturn to top\nJoint taxes\nReturn to top\nWages tax\nWages tax receipts continued to grow in January 2020, with gross revenue increasing by 4.5% on the year. Child benefit payments, which are financed from wages tax receipts, rose by 4.7% on the year due to a \xe2\x82\xac10 per child increase in monthly child benefit that came into effect in July 2019. On balance, cash receipts from wages tax increased by 4.4% on the year in January 2020.\nReturn to top\nCorporation tax\nGross receipts from corporation tax stood at approximately \xe2\x82\xac1.1bn in January 2020, a substantial increase on the \xe2\x82\xac0.3bn taken in the same month last year. This rise can be attributed primarily to back payments for past tax assessment periods. In addition, retroactive prepayments were also up sharply. Taxpayer paybacks of investment allowance slightly exceeded payouts in January. However, this had only a negligible impact on results. On balance, cash receipts rose on the year in January 2020 to reach \xe2\x82\xac1.1bn.\nReturn to top\nAssessed income tax\nGross receipts from assessed income tax posted a substantial year-on-year increase of 24.6% in January 2020. This trend can be attributed primarily to a rise in retroactive prepayments. The balance between back-payments and refunds also improved.\nEmployee refunds were down by 4.8% on the year in January; after these are subtracted from the gross figure (along with investment allowance payments and owner-occupied homes premiums, which are insignificant in terms of amount), net cash receipts from assessed income tax increased by 46.8% year-on-year in January 2020.\nReturn to top\nNon-assessed taxes on earnings\nJanuary 2020 saw a 24.1% year-on-year rise in gross receipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings. Refunds by the Federal Central Tax Office, which are financed from this revenue, increased to approximately \xe2\x82\xac75m. As a result, cash receipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings grew by 21.4% on the year.\nReturn to top\nFinal withholding tax on interest and capital gains\nRevenue from final withholding tax on interest and capital gains posted a year-on-year rise of 41.8% in January 2020. There are no statistics breaking down this figure into its two components, but it can be assumed that the rise is attributable to the contribution made by capital gains.\nReturn to top\nValue added taxes\nReceipts from value added taxes were up by only 0.7% on the year in January 2020. Revenue from domestic VAT fell slightly, by 0.1% in year-on-year terms, while receipts from import VAT grew by 3.5%.\nReturn to top\nFederal taxes\nIn January 2020, revenue from taxes accruing solely to the Federation was 10.2% higher than in January 2019. Receipts from tobacco duty recorded a particularly strong surge of 86.0%, due to a revenue shift from December 2019 to January 2020 attributable to accounting technicalities. Receipts from the solidarity surcharge climbed by 11.0% on the year thanks to growth in revenues from income and corporation tax (which constitute its tax base). Revenue gains were also posted for motor vehicle tax (up by 7.1%), energy duty (up by 4.2%) and insurance tax (up by 5.4%). Drops in yields were recorded for aviation tax (down by 27.9%) and alcohol duty (down by 8.3%). Trends in revenue from other taxes had only a minor impact on the overall results for federal taxes.\nReturn to top\nTaxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder\nRevenue from taxes accruing solely to the L\xc3\xa4nder increased significantly in January 2020, by 10.3% on the year. This was mainly due to substantial growth in revenue from real property transfer tax (up by 8.5%) and inheritance tax (up by 21.1%). The yield from fire protection tax increased by 4.1%, while receipts from betting and lottery tax were up by 5.7%. Revenue from beer duty was down by 22.6% on the year.\nReturn to top\nBorrowing and guarantees\nDebt trends for the Federation and its special funds (in \xe2\x82\xacm)\nDebt trends for the Federation and its special funds (in \xe2\x82\xacm)\nDebt level\nBorrowing\n(increase)\nDebt repayment\n(decrease)\nDebt level\nChange in debt level\n(balance)\n31 December 2019\nJanuary 2020\nJanuary 2020\n31\xc2\xa0January 2020\nJanuary 2020\nBudget borrowing\n1,078,261\n30,511\n-22,005\n1,086,767\n8,506\nbroken down by purpose\nFederal budget\n1,011,378\n29,015\n-22,005\n1,018,388\n7,010\nFinancial Market Stabilisation Fund (loans for expenses pursuant to section 9 (1) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act)\n22,683\n-3\n-\n22,680\n-3\nFinancial Market Stabilisation Fund (loans for resolution authorities pursuant to section 9 (5) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act)\n25,000\n1,500\n-\n26,500\n1,500\nInvestment and Redemption Fund19,200\n0\n-\n19,200\n0\nbroken down by debt type\nFederal securities1,066,988\n30,511\n-22,000\n1,075,499\n8,511\nFederal bonds\n719,342\n13,062\n-22,000\n710,404\n-8,938\n30-year federal bonds\n230,567\n1,351\n-\n231,918\n1,351\n10-year federal bonds\n488,775\n11,711\n-22,000\n478,486\n-10,289\nInflation-linked federal securities\n69,805\n503\n-\n70,308\n503\n30-year inflation-linked federal bonds\n8,548\n0\n-\n8,548\n0\n10-year inflation-linked federal bonds\n61,256\n503\n-\n61,760\n503\nFederal notes\n174,719\n3,543\n-\n178,262\n3,543\nFederal Treasury notes\n89,230\n5,319\n-\n94,549\n5,319\nTreasury discount papers issued by the Federation\n13,487\n8,083\n-\n21,570\n8,083\nOther federal securities405\n-\n-\n405\n0\nSecuritised loans6,800\n-\n-5\n6,795\n-5\nOther loans and ordinary debts4,474\n-\n-\n4,474\n0\nbroken down by maturity\nup to one year165,886\n176,127\n10,241\none to four years322,258\n320,656\n-1,602\nover four years590,117\n589,985\n-133\nAdditional information1\nLiabilities from the indexing of inflation-linked federal securities6,021\n5,795\n-226\nReserves in accordance with the Final Payment Financing Act\n(Schlusszahlungsfinanzierungsgesetz)4,554\n4,573\n19\n1Liabilities resulting from indexing include the amount by which the original issuance price has increased due to inflation between the start date and the specified reference date.\nIn contrast, reserves include only the increases that are noted on coupon payment dates (15 April of every year) (section 4(1) of the Final Payment Financing Act) and on\nreopening dates for inflation-linked securities (section 4(2) of the Final Payment Financing Act).\nAny discrepancies in totals are due to rounding.\nSource: Federal Ministry of Finance\nGuarantees\nAuthorised amount\nAmount allocated\nas of\n31\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02019\nAmount allocated\nas of\n31\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02018\nin \xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa0bn\nExport credit guarantees\n148.0\n119.4\n120.7\nLoans to foreign debtors, foreign direct investment, EIB loans\n58.0\n42.8\n42.7\nFinancial cooperation projects\n28.5\n25.6\n22.8\nFood stockpiling\n0.7\n0.0\n0.0\nDomestic guarantees\n125.0\n115.8\n104.7\nReturn to top\nCalendar\nPublication schedule1 of the monthly reports\xc2\xa0Monthly reportReporting periodPublication dateMarch 2020 issueFebruary 202020 March 2020April 2020 issueMarch\xc2\xa0202021 April 2020May 2020 issueApril\xc2\xa0202022 May 2020June 2020 issueMay\xc2\xa0202019 June 2020July 2020 issueJune 202021 July 2020August 2020 issueJuly 202020 August 2020September 2020 issueAugust 202022 September 2020October 2020 issueSeptember 202022 October 2020November 2020 issueOctober 202020 November 2020December 2020 issueNovember 202022 December 2020\n1In accordance with the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s Special Data Dissemination Standard Plus (SDDS Plus); see http://dsbb.imf.org\nSource: Federal Ministry of Finance\nKey dates on the fiscal and economic policy agenda22\xe2\x80\x9323 February 2020\nMeeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\n16\xe2\x80\x9317 March 2020\nEurogroup and ECOFIN Council meetings in Brussels\n16\xe2\x80\x9317 April 2020\nMeeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington, D.C.\n17\xe2\x80\x9319 April 2020\nSpring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, D.C.\n24\xe2\x80\x9325 April 2020\nEurogroup and informal ECOFIN meetings in Zagreb, Croatia\n18\xe2\x80\x9319 May 2020\nEurogroup and ECOFIN Council meetings in Brussels\nClick here for the full schedule (in German)\nMore on this topic\nMonthly report archive\n31 January 2020\nPhas\xc2\xading out coal to ful\xc2\xadfil cli\xc2\xadmate tar\xc2\xadgets\nOn 29 January 2020, the German cabinet adopted draft legislation on the phasing out of coal in Germany. The bill sets out a detailed roadmap for shutting down coal-fired power stations, which are harmful to the climate. The Federation has allocated \xe2\x82\xac40bn for the structural transformation. The funds will help the affected regions to build new capacity and create new jobs.\nGermany is the first industrialised country that is phasing out both nuclear- and coal-powered electricity generation and making renewable energies central to its future energy supply. Phasing out coal will massively reduce Germany\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years. The roadmap for phasing out coal-fired electricity generation, which was agreed by the Federation and the L\xc3\xa4nder, is based on recommendations from the government\xe2\x80\x99s expert commission for growth, structural change and employment. The roadmap sends a signal to the public and to businesses in Germany\xe2\x80\x99s coal-mining regions that the social consequences of the phase-out will be mitigated and that new economic prospects will be created.\nThe Federation and the L\xc3\xa4nder plan to reach an agreement in late spring 2020 on implementing legislation to achieve positive structural change in the affected regions (Strukturst\xc3\xa4rkungsgesetz Kohleregionen). It is undeniable that coal and coal-fired electricity production still plays an important economic role in some regions today. These regions, and the workers and businesses located there, face special challenges. The political decision to end coal-fired electricity production entails a special responsibility towards the people and regions affected. For this reason, the workers and the coal-mining regions will receive financial support to enable the creation of new economic structures offering well-paid jobs. The German federal government is creating a solution that balances a comprehensive set of economic, labour-related and environmental aspects: it achieves a fair balance between the interests of eastern and western Germany, and between the interests of areas with power stations and coal-mining regions, on the one hand, and ambitious climate policies on the other.\nThe Federation and L\xc3\xa4nder have agreed on the following specific measures:\nClear phase-out pathway for lignite: Lignite-fired power stations will be successively taken offline in the coming years, beginning in 2020 with the plants that emit the most CO2.Step-by-step reduction in coal-fired electricity production: Between 2020 and 2026, invitations to tender will be held for companies that wish to shut down coal-fired power plants in exchange for compensation. The compensation amounts will be kept as low as possible. Between 2027 and 2038, the remaining coal-fired power plants will be shut down on a mandatory legal basis, without compensation being paid. The phase-out pathways will be reviewed in detail in 2026 and 2029.Mitigation of the social consequences of the phase-out: The coal sector is highly important for many people in the affected regions. The German government is therefore organising the phase-out in a clear and transparent fashion that allows individuals and businesses to plan ahead. Older workers, who are particularly affected by the structural change, will be paid an adjustment benefit until 2043. This is a similar arrangement to the one that already exists for coal mining. Workers affected by the structural change will also benefit from the Skills Development Opportunities Act (Qualifizierungschancengesetz), which came into effect in January 2019. The law provides for enhanced support for further training and allows workers to obtain new qualifications.Federal support for coal-mining regions: The government\xe2\x80\x99s climate policies will generate new economic momentum in many sectors, leading to the creation of new, well-paid jobs. It is key that new economic and social prospects be created in the regions most affected by the phase-out of coal so that these regions can derive particular benefit from this new momentum. In total, the federal government will make up to \xe2\x82\xac40bn available by 2038 (including \xe2\x82\xac14bn in financial assistance and a further \xe2\x82\xac26bn from the budgets of the relevant federal ministries). These funds will be used for new railways and roads, new research facilities, new locations for federal agencies, and education and training, among many other measures.Faster expansion of renewable energy: As part of a reform of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz), measures will be adopted to further expand the use of wind and solar power. In parallel, support for the combined generation of heat and power will be enhanced. The goal of ensuring that 65% of electricity is generated by renewable resources by 2030 will be enshrined in law.Compensation for lignite producers: Granting compensation to lignite producers creates legal certainty, so that the phasing-out of coal does not lead to unforeseeable legal risks. Originally, lignite producers had the right to extract lignite until the 2040s. The new roadmap provides for compensation payments because maintaining social consensus also involves compensating businesses for investments that they made on the basis of agreements that were in place at the time, but which have now been superseded. In return, the companies will refrain from laying off employees for operational reasons and from taking legal action against the federal government. This creates transparency and predictability for all stakeholders.\nand predictability for all stakeholders.\nMore on this topic\nKey el\xc2\xade\xc2\xadments of the Cli\xc2\xadmate Ac\xc2\xadtion Pro\xc2\xadgramme 2030\n31 January 2020\nOverview of fed\xc2\xader\xc2\xadal bud\xc2\xadgetary and fi\xc2\xadnan\xc2\xadcial da\xc2\xadta up to and in\xc2\xadclud\xc2\xading De\xc2\xadcem\xc2\xadber 2019\nTranslated extracts from the Federal Ministry of Finance\xe2\x80\x99s January 2020 monthly report.\nTax revenue in December 2019\nBorrowing and guarantees\nCalendar\nTax revenue in December 2019\n2019 trends in tax revenue (excluding local authority taxes)\n2019 trends in tax revenue (excluding local authority taxes)1\n2019\nDecember\nYear-on-year change\nJanuary to December\nYear-on-year change\n2019 estimates4\nYear-on-year change\nin \xe2\x82\xacmin %in \xe2\x82\xacmin %\nin \xe2\x82\xacm\nin %\nJoint taxesWages tax226,902+3.4219,660+5.5219,900+5.6Assessed income tax16,870+6.663,711+5.562,500+3,5Non-assessed taxes on earnings2,102+5.223,485+1.323,230+0,2Final withholding tax on interest and capital gains\n(including the former withholding tax on interest income)\n425\n+8.1\n5,146\n-25.3\n4,882\n-29.2\nCorporation tax\n7,983\n+0.6\n32,013\n-4.2\n32,160\n-3.8\nValue added taxes (VAT)21,296+1.9243,256+3.6243,300+3.6Trade tax apportionment982-9.94,700-5.44,783-3.7Increased trade tax apportionment771-20.13,414-16,93,381-17.7Total joint taxes77,267+2.9595,386+3.4594,136+3.1Taxes accruing to the Federation\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Energy duty8,465-0.640,683-0.540,600-0.7Tobacco duty1,464-21.514,257-0.614,300-0.3Alcohol duty (formerly spirits duty)214-1.62,118-0.72,130-0.1Insurance tax669+2.914,136+2.614,100+2.3Electricity duty591+13.56,689-2.56,650-3.0Motor vehicle tax625+15.89,372+3.69,340+3.2Aviation tax121-7.01,182-0.41,210+2.0Nuclear fuel duty0X0X-1XSolidarity surcharge3,001+4.119,646+3.819,450+2.8Other taxes accruing to the Federation142+3.31,466+2.11,468+2.2Total taxes accruing to the Federation15,294-1.1109,548+0.9109,248+0.6Taxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder\nInheritance tax\n661+0.76,987+2.66,857+0.6Real property transfer tax1,491+28.415,789+12.115,460+9.8Betting and lottery tax164+10.21,975+4.31,983+4.7Beer duty46+22.9617-5.8610-6.9Other taxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder41+3.7482+3.2482+3.2Total taxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder2,404+17.625,850+8.125,392+6.2EU own resources\nCustoms duties382-8.45,085+0.65,090+0.7EU own resources (VAT-based)121-39.82,520+5.72,500+4.8EU own resources (GNI-based)1,010-63.023,317+10.324,120+14.1Total EU own resources1,512-54.830,921+8.231,710+10.9Federation346,362+7.8329,052+2.1328,223+1,8L\xc3\xa4nder340,275+1.3324,517+3.3322,731+2.8EU1,512-54.830,921+8.231,710+10.9Local authorities\xe2\x80\x99 share of income tax and value added tax7,197+4.751,378+5.851,202+5.4Total tax revenue (excluding local authority taxes)\n95,346+2.5735,869+3.1733,866+2.8\n1Methodology: Total cash income from the various taxes is recorded and allocated to the various government levels as stipulated by law.

This increase was mainly driven by higher receipts from joint taxes. Revenue from assessed income tax again provided a positive surprise in December, an important month for receipts from this tax. In contrast, growth in revenue from corporation tax was far more subdued in December, the fourth high-yield month for this tax in 2019. Receipts from wages tax also made a significant contribution to overall tax revenue, even if revenue growth for this tax was less dynamic than in previous months. Revenue from non-assessed taxes on earnings also posted substantial year-on-year gains. Receipts from final withholding tax on interest and capital gains were also up on the year, compared with a low baseline in December 2018. The take from value added taxes rose moderately, while receipts from taxes that accrue solely to the Federation were slightly down on the year in December. Receipts from taxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder posted a marked increase of 17.6%.\nReturn to top\nEU own resources\nTransfers of own resources to the EU, including customs duties, totalled approximately \xe2\x82\xac1.5bn in December 2019, a year-on-year drop of 54.8%. This was due to lower transfers of GNI-based and VAT-based own resources in December 2019, because large transfers for agricultural payments in February 2019 were balanced out over the course of the year. Monthly fluctuations occur over the course of the year based on the EU\xe2\x80\x99s financing needs at any given time.\nReturn to top\nCumulative overview for fiscal year 2019\nIn fiscal year 2019, total tax receipts increased by 3.1% on the year. Revenue from joint taxes grew by 3.4%. Taxes accruing to the Federation posted an increase of 0.9%, while taxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder were up by 8.1%.\nReturn to top\nDistribution among the Federation, L\xc3\xa4nder and local authorities\nThe Federation\xe2\x80\x99s tax receipts (after accounting for supplementary federal grants to the L\xc3\xa4nder) rose by 7.8% on the year in December 2019. This was the result of a 5.2% increase in revenue from the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s share of joint taxes. Here it should be noted that shifts in VAT revenue between the Federation and the L\xc3\xa4nder distorted the year-on-year trend in December 2019. New legislation was adopted in December 2018 that (a) extended and adjusted federal support for the L\xc3\xa4nder and local authorities to help them pay for refugee-related costs and (b) adjusted revenue distribution arrangements between the Federation and L\xc3\xa4nder following the financial closure of the German Unity Fund. The new rules modified the vertical distribution of VAT revenue, benefiting the L\xc3\xa4nder and reducing the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s revenue by roughly \xe2\x82\xac1.6bn. In December 2019, too, the Federation provided around \xe2\x82\xac399m to the L\xc3\xa4nder and local authorities for refugee-related costs and \xe2\x82\xac493m for costs related to improving the quality of childcare provision. However, the total of these one-time payments was around \xe2\x82\xac700m lower than in December 2018. This has the effect of increasing revenue in 2019 in comparison with the same period of 2018. Overall, the percentage of joint tax revenue that is allocated to the Federation was smaller in 2019 than in 2018. In addition, transfers of own resources to the EU were lower, as described above. Lower revenue from federal taxes had a slight negative impact on overall results.\nL\xc3\xa4nder tax receipts were up by 1.3% on the year in December. This gain was driven mainly by receipts from the share of joint taxes allocated to the L\xc3\xa4nder, which were up by 0.5% on the year, partly due to the higher percentage of VAT revenue that went to the L\xc3\xa4nder in 2019. Receipts from taxes that accrue only to the L\xc3\xa4nder were also up tangibly on the year in December, by 17.6%. The share of revenue from joint taxes allocated to local authorities was 4.7% higher than in December 2018.\nReturn to top\nJoint taxes\nReturn to top\nWages tax\nWages tax receipts grew in December 2019, with gross revenue up by 3.9% compared with December 2018. Child benefit payments, which are financed from wages tax receipts, rose by 7.6% on the year due to a \xe2\x82\xac10 per child increase in monthly child benefit from July onwards. On balance, cash receipts from wages tax rose by 3.4% on the year in December 2019. Taken cumulatively, cash receipts from wages tax were up strongly, by 5.5% on the year, in fiscal year 2019.\nReturn to top\nCorporation tax\nGross receipts from corporation tax posted a relatively modest year-on-year increase of 0.5% in December, the important fourth prepayments month in 2019. Taxpayer paybacks of investment allowance slightly exceeded payouts in December. However, this had only a negligible impact on results. On balance, cash receipts were up by 0.6% on the year in December. Cumulative cash receipts from corporation tax fell by 4.2% in year-on-year terms in fiscal year 2019.\nReturn to top\nAssessed income tax\nGross receipts from assessed income tax posted a surprisingly strong year-on-year increase of 6.6% in December, the fourth prepayments month of the year. Overall, gross revenue from this tax showed positive growth in fiscal year 2019. Employee refunds were up by 5.2% on the year in December; after these are subtracted from the gross figure (along with investment allowance payments and owner-occupied homes premiums, which are insignificant in terms of amount), net cash receipts from assessed income tax increased by 6.6% in December\xc2\xa02019 over the same period in\xc2\xa02018. In cumulative terms, cash receipts from assessed income tax were up notably, by 5.5% on the year, in 2019.\nReturn to top\nNon-assessed taxes on earnings\nDecember 2019 saw a 6.4% year-on-year rise in gross receipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings. Taking into account a 47.2% increase in refunds paid out by the Federal Central Tax Office, which are financed from this revenue, cash receipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings rose by 5.2%. Cash receipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings were up by 1.3% on the year in fiscal year 2019.\nReturn to top\nFinal withholding tax on interest and capital gains\nRevenue from final withholding tax on interest and capital gains recorded year-on-year growth of 8.1% in December 2019. However, this large increase was due to a low baseline figure in 2018. Cash receipts from final withholding tax on interest and capital gains were down by 25.3% in fiscal year 2019 compared with 2018. There are no statistics breaking down this figure into its two components, but it can be assumed that capital gains made a significantly smaller contribution to overall revenue from this tax in 2019 than they did in 2018.\nReturn to top\nValue added taxes\nReceipts from value added taxes were up by 1.9% on the year in December 2019. Domestic VAT revenue rose by 3.8% in year-on-year terms, while receipts from import VAT declined by 3.8%. Cumulative cash receipts from value added taxes recorded a year-on-year gain of 3.6% in fiscal year 2019.\nReturn to top\nTaxes accruing to the Federation\nIn December 2019, revenue from taxes accruing solely to the Federation was down by 1.1% on the year. Receipts from tobacco duty fell by 21.5% in year-on-year terms. However, this was due to a revenue shift from December 2019 to January 2020 for accounting reasons. Revenue from aviation tax and energy duty fell by 7.0% and 0.6% respectively. Receipts from the solidarity surcharge climbed by 4.1% on the year thanks to growth in revenues from income and corporation tax (which constitute its tax base). Receipts from motor vehicle tax and insurance tax also posted substantial gains, up by 15.8% and 2.9%, respectively. Trends in revenue from other taxes had only a minor impact on the overall results for federal taxes.\nReturn to top\nTaxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder\nRevenue from taxes accruing solely to the L\xc3\xa4nder increased significantly in December 2019, by 17.6% on the year. This was driven by a surge in revenue from real property transfer tax, which was up by 28.4%. Other taxes accruing solely to the L\xc3\xa4nder also posted year-on-year revenue growth in December, including fire protection tax (+3.7%), inheritance tax (+0.7%), beer duty (+22.9%) and betting and lottery tax (+10.2%).\nReturn to top\nBorrowing and guarantees\nDebt trends for the Federation and its special funds (in \xe2\x82\xacm)\nDebt trends for the Federation and its special funds (in \xe2\x82\xacm)\nDebt level\nBorrowing\n(increase)\nDebt repayment\n(decrease)\nDebt level\nChange in debt level\n(balance)\n30\xc2\xa0November 2019\nDecember 2019\nDecember 2019\n31\xc2\xa0December 2019\nDecember 2019\nBudget borrowing\n1,092,420\n7,402\n-21,561\n1,078,261\n-14,159\nbroken down by purpose\nFederal budget\n1,025,896\n4,503\n-19,020\n1,011,378\n14,518\nFinancial Market Stabilisation Fund (loans for expenses pursuant to section 9 (1) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act)\n22,712\n1,461\n-1,490\n22,683\n-29\nFinancial Market Stabilisation Fund (loans for resolution authorities pursuant to section 9 (5) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act)\n24,600\n400\n-\n25,000\n400\nInvestment and Redemption Fund\n19,212\n1,038\n-1,051\n19,200\n-12\nbroken down by debt type\nFederal securities1,080,3957,402-20,8101,066,988-13,408\nFederal bonds\n717,7721,570-719,3421,570\n30-year federal bonds\n230,414\n152\n-\n230,567\n152\n10-year federal bonds\n487,358\n1,417\n-\n488,775\n1,417\nInflation-linked federal securities\n69,884\n-79\n-\n69,805\n-79\n30-year inflation-linked federal bonds\n8,548\n0\n-\n8,548\n0\n10-year inflation-linked federal bonds\n61,335\n-79\n-\n61,256\n-79\nFederal notes\n174,848\n-129\n-\n174,719\n-129\nFederal Treasury notes\n98,252\n3,978\n-13,000\n89,230\n-9,022\nTreasury discount papers issued by the Federation\n18,443\n2,063\n-7,019\n13,487\n-4,956\nOther federal securities\n1,195\n-\n-790\n405\n-790\nSecuritised loans\n7,550\n-\n-750\n6,800\n-750\nOther loans and ordinary debts\n4,475\n-\n-2\n4,474\n-2\nbroken down by maturity\nup to one year\n174,565\n156,886\n-8,679\none to four years\n330,984\n322,258\n-8,726\nover four years\n586,872\n590,117\n3,246\nAdditional information1\nLiabilities from the indexing of inflation-linked federal securities\n5,925\n6,021\n96\nReserves in accordance with the Final Payment Financing Act\n(Schlusszahlungsfinanzierungsgesetz)\n4,554\n4,554\n-\n1Liabilities resulting from indexing include the amount by which the original issuance price has increased due to inflation between the start date and the specified reference date.\nIn contrast, reserves include only the increases that are noted on coupon payment dates (15 April of every year) (section 4(1) of the Final Payment Financing Act) and on\nreopening dates for inflation-linked securities (section 4(2) of the Final Payment Financing Act).\nAny discrepancies in totals are due to rounding.\nSource: Federal Ministry of Finance\nGuarantees\nAuthorised amount\nAmount allocated\nas of\n31\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02019\nAmount allocated\nas of\n31\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02018\nin \xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa0bn\nExport credit guarantees\n148.0\n119.4\n120.7\nLoans to foreign debtors, foreign direct investment, EIB loans\n58.0\n42.8\n42.7\nFinancial cooperation projects\n28.5\n25.6\n22.8\nFood stockpiling\n0.7\n0.0\n0.0\nDomestic guarantees\n125.0\n115.8\n104.7\nInternational financial institutions\n80.0\n60.1\n60.1\nTreuhandanstalt successor organisations\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\nInterest compensation guarantees\n15.0\n15.0\n15.0\nReturn to top\nCalendar\nPublication schedule1 of the monthly reports\xc2\xa0Monthly reportReporting periodPublication dateFebruary 2020 issueJanuary 202021 February 2020March 2020 issueFebruary 202020 March 2020April 2020 issueMarch\xc2\xa0202021 April 2020May 2020 issueApril\xc2\xa0202022 May 2020June 2020 issueMay\xc2\xa0202019 June 2020July 2020 issueJune 202021 July 2020August 2020 issueJuly 202020 August 2020September 2020 issueAugust 202022 September 2020October 2020 issueSeptember 202022 October 2020November 2020 issueOctober 202020 November 2020December 2020 issueNovember 202022 December 2020\n1In accordance with the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s Special Data Dissemination Standard Plus (SDDS Plus);

Based on the modified Temporary Framework for state aid measures published on 3 April 2020 by the European Commission, the German government is now introducing a comprehensive Quick Loan Programme (KfW-Schnellkredit) for small and medium-sized businesses. The programme will be run by the government-owned promotional bank KfW.\nFhere is no blueprint for responding to this pandemic. We in the German government must act decisively and vigorously, while at the same time keeping a constant close eye on developments. We are now launching a new KfW Quick Loan Programme in addition to the other assistance programmes that we have adopted. The new programme targets small and medium-sized firms that need very, very rapid support, and its conditions are different from those in the other assistance programmes, which of course will continue to operate as well.Finance Minister Olaf Scholz\nSmall and medium-sized companies form the backbone of our economy, and they are especially hard-hit by the current crisis. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s essential for us to safeguard this unique, broad-based cornerstone of our economy in order to ensure that we can re-start our engines at full power when the crisis is over. Small and medium-sized businesses make up 99.5% of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s firms. They generate roughly 35% of our total revenue, employ nearly 60% of our workers, and provide over 80% of our apprenticeships. For this reason, we are adding another comprehensive programme to our protective shield for SMEs. We are introducing the KfW Quick Loan Programme, which will offer loans with terms of 10 years, and the government will cover 100% of the risk.Economic Affairs Minister Peter Altmaier\nThese loans will provide liability waivers of 100%. In addition, the usual risk assessments will be waived. In this way, we are making sure that businesses which have run into financial difficulty solely due to the pandemic can access credit swiftly. We expect to receive a very large number of applications. Together with banks, we will do our utmost to put the technical details in place that will enable the rapid disbursement of loans.KfW Chief Executive Officer G\xc3\xbcnther Br\xc3\xa4unig\nThe basics of the KfW Quick Loan Programme:\nSmall and medium-sized firms that recorded a profit in 2019 (or on average over the past three years) will be eligible for an \xe2\x80\x9cinstant loan\xe2\x80\x9d with the following features and conditions:\nQuick loans are available to small and medium-sized businesses that have over 10 employees and that have been active on the market since at least 1 January 2019. Each eligible business can obtain a loan equalling up to three months\xe2\x80\x99 revenue from 2019, with a maximum amount of \xe2\x82\xac800,000 for firms with over 50 employees and \xe2\x82\xac500,000 for firms with up to 50 employees.Companies must not have been in financial difficulty as of 31 December 2019 and must have been financially stable at that time. Loans will provided at 3% interest for terms of 10 years.KfW will provide banks with 100% liability waivers that are backed up by government guarantees.Loans will be approved without further risk assessment by banks or by KfW. This will ensure the quick approval of loans.\nThe KfW Quick Loan Programme will get started as soon as it is approved by the European Commission.\nSubject Logo\nArea Menu\nSpeeches, Interviews and Articles\nPress Releases\n:\nMedia Images\nMedia Contacts\nAdditional Information\nCit\xc2\xadi\xc2\xadzens\xe2\x80\x99 Di\xc2\xada\xc2\xadlogue on the Fu\xc2\xadture of Eu\xc2\xadrope\nMonthly report\nPrint this page\nReturn to top\nPage overview\nHome\nIs\xc2\xadsues\nPriority issues\nPublic Finances\nTaxation\nFinancial Markets\nEurope\nStamps\nAbout\nMinister and Senior Leadership\nDirectorates-General\nAdvisory Board\nEvents at the Ministry\nHistory\nVisitors' Service\nDirections\nRe\xc2\xadsources\nPublications\nLaws in English\nMultimedia\nLivestream\nPress\nSpeeches, Interviews and Articles\nPress Releases\nMedia Images\nMedia Contacts\nMetanavigation\nLe\xc2\xadgal No\xc2\xadtice\nPri\xc2\xadva\xc2\xadcy Pol\xc2\xadi\xc2\xadcy\n\xc2\xa9 Federal Ministry of Finance\nVisit the Federal Ministry of Finance on social media and share\nTwitter BMF (Opens\xc2\xa0new\xc2\xa0window)\nInstagram BMF (Opens\xc2\xa0new\xc2\xa0window)\n\xc3\xb6ffnet den YouTube-Kanal des BMF.

Tax revenue (including transfers of EU own resources to the EU) was up by 10.7% (about \xe2\x82\xac4.3bn) on the year.\nOther revenue recorded a year-on-year gain of 26.3% (about \xe2\x82\xac0.8bn). This was primarily due to the administrative fines paid to the Federal Cartel Office; receipts from the distance-based commercial vehicle toll were higher on the year as well.\nReturn to top\nExpenditure\nFederal expenditure in the first two months of 2020 totalled approximately \xe2\x82\xac65.9bn, an increase of 1.5% (about \xe2\x82\xac1.0bn) over the same period last year. Federal spending is separated into consumption and investment spending. Consumption spending was up by 2.7% on the year in the first two months of 2020. Two key factors driving this trend were (a)\xc2\xa0grants for the permanent discontinuation of subsidised coal mining, which were due in 2020 and have now been fully disbursed (an increase of about \xe2\x82\xac1bn on the year) and (b)\xc2\xa0higher payments to social security funds (an increase of about \xe2\x82\xac0.9bn on the year). Interest expenditure was down on the year by 8.3%.\nInvestment spending stood at \xe2\x82\xac3.8bn after the first two months of 2020, a decline of 14.8% (or \xe2\x82\xac0.7bn) compared with the same period last year. This is attributable mainly to the discontinuation of compensation payments from the Federation to the L\xc3\xa4nder (the Federation and L\xc3\xa4nder agreed to end these payments as part of the reorganisation of financial relations between government levels that took effect at the start of 2020). Instead of receiving compensation payments, the L\xc3\xa4nder now receive a higher share of VAT revenue. Construction investment was up on the year by about \xe2\x82\xac0.3bn, or 44.7%.\nReturn to top\nFiscal balance\nThe federal budget recorded a deficit of \xe2\x82\xac18.3bn for the January\xe2\x80\x93February 2020 period.\nRevenue and expenditure are subject to strong fluctuations over the course of the fiscal year and thus have an uneven effect on cash funds in individual months. Net borrowing also tends to fluctuate considerably over the course of the year. This means that the fiscal balance at any given point in the year and the corresponding net borrowing figures are not reliable indicators of the end-of-year figures for the fiscal balance and net borrowing.\nReturn to top\nTrends in federal expenditure by function\nTrends in federal expenditure by function\nTrends in federal expenditure by function\nActual 2019\n2020

This positive trend was driven by another significant year-on-year increase in receipts from joint taxes (up by 5.7%), as wages tax and value added taxes posted major revenue growth on the year. Corporation tax and assessed income tax also recorded gains as a result of assessments from previous years. As in January, the yield from withholding tax on interest and capital gains also saw major growth. In contrast, revenue from non-assessed taxes on earnings was down sharply on the year. The yield from taxes accruing solely to the Federation rose significantly on the year. Revenue from taxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder surged by 13.5%.\nReturn to top\nEU own resources\nTransfers of own resources to the EU, including customs duties, totalled approximately \xe2\x82\xac3.1bn in February 2020, a year-on-year decline of 50.7%. In January, the European Commission had already drawn down an additional twelfth of the amount earmarked for the entire year, for the purpose of financing its functions. In February, the Commission drew down a significantly lower amount of VAT and GNI-based own resources compared with February 2019. Monthly fluctuations occur over the course of the year based on the EU\xe2\x80\x99s financing needs at any given time. However, monthly requisitions are generally in line with the financial framework for the current year.\nReturn to top\nCumulative overview of the January\xe2\x80\x93February 2020 period\nTax revenue increased by 7.1% overall in the first two months of 2020. This upward trend was reflected in receipts from joint taxes (up by 6.5%), taxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder (up by 11.8%), and taxes accruing to the Federation (up by 9.8%).\nReturn to top\nDistribution among the Federation, L\xc3\xa4nder and local authorities\nThe Federation\xe2\x80\x99s overall tax revenue (after accounting for supplementary federal grants to the L\xc3\xa4nder) was up significantly in February 2020 over the same month last year, by 21.9%. One factor here was the marked year-on-year gain that the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s tax receipts recorded in February. For example, revenue from purely federal taxes was up by 9.8%. In addition, the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s share of joint taxes also recorded a solid increase of 3.8%, thanks to high receipts from joint taxes. However, the reorganisation of the fiscal equalisation system, which came into effect on 1\xc2\xa0January\xc2\xa02020, changed the distribution of VAT revenue to the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantage. This tempered year-on-year growth in the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s share of VAT revenue, which rose by only 2.1% in February. In addition, supplementary federal grants to the L\xc3\xa4nder were markedly higher on the year in February 2020. However, the main explanatory factor for the high growth rate in February is not the increase in tax revenue, but rather the sharp year-on-year decline in transfers of own resources from the federal budget to the European Union in February.\nL\xc3\xa4nder tax receipts were up by 8.0% on the year in February\xc2\xa02020. This was due mainly to higher yields from the share of joint taxes allocated to the L\xc3\xa4nder, which were up by 7.3% on the year. Receipts from taxes that accrue only to the L\xc3\xa4nder were also up sharply on the year in February, by 13.5%. Local authorities\xe2\x80\x99 take from their share of joint taxes was 7.0% higher than in February\xc2\xa02019.\nReturn to top\nJoint taxes\nReturn to top\nWages tax\nWages tax receipts continued to grow in February\xc2\xa02020, with gross revenue increasing by 4.9% on the year. Child benefit payments, which are financed from wages tax receipts, rose by 4.0% on the year due to a \xe2\x82\xac10 per child increase in monthly child benefit that came into effect in July\xc2\xa02019. On balance, cash receipts from wages tax increased by 5.4% on the year in February\xc2\xa02020 and by 4.9% on the year in cumulative terms over the first two months of 2020.\nReturn to top\nCorporation tax\nGross revenue from corporation tax was approximately \xe2\x82\xac11m in February, a month when revenue from this tax tends to be low. In February of 2019, refunds of corporation tax totalled approximately \xe2\x82\xac32m. Taxpayer refunds of investment allowance slightly exceeded payouts in February. However, this had only a negligible impact on results. On balance, cash receipts from corporation tax stood at roughly \xe2\x82\xac11m in February 2020. In cumulative terms, cash receipts from corporation tax rose to approximately \xe2\x82\xac1.1bn in the first two months of 2020.\nReturn to top\nAssessed income tax\nGross receipts from assessed income tax posted a substantial year-on-year increase of 9.9% in February\xc2\xa02020. Employee refunds were down by 12.8% on the year in February; after these are subtracted from the gross figure (along with investment allowance payments and owner-occupied homes premiums, which are insignificant in terms of amount), net cash receipts from assessed income tax increased by 47.5% in February\xc2\xa02020 over the same period in 2019. In cumulative terms, cash receipts from assessed income tax were up by 47.0% on the year in the January\xe2\x80\x93February 2020 period.\nReturn to top\nNon-assessed taxes on earnings\nFebruary 2020 saw an 18.9% year-on-year decline in gross receipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings. Refunds by the Federal Central Tax Office, which are financed from this revenue, fell by 21.6% to approximately\xc2\xa0\xe2\x82\xac84m. As a result, cash receipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings were down by 18.6% on the year. Cumulative cash receipts from non-assessed taxes on earnings in January and February 2020 were up by 10.3% on the year.\nReturn to top\nFinal withholding tax on interest and capital gains\nRevenue from final withholding tax on interest and capital gains climbed by 32.9% on the year in February\xc2\xa02020. There are no statistics breaking down this figure into its two components, but it can be assumed that the rise is attributable to the contribution made by capital gains. In cumulative terms, cash receipts from withholding tax on interest and capital gains were up by 38.0% on the year in the January\xe2\x80\x93February 2020 period.\nReturn to top\nValue added taxes\nReceipts from value added taxes were up by 5.1% on the year in February 2020. Receipts from domestic VAT rose substantially by 7.3% on the year, while import VAT revenue fell by 2.3%. Cumulative cash receipts from value added taxes were up by 3.2% on the year in the first two months of 2020.\nReturn to top\nFederal taxes\nIn February\xc2\xa02020, revenue from taxes accruing solely to the Federation was up by 9.8% over the same month last year. Insurance tax posted particularly noticeable revenue growth of 16.7% on the year. Insurance tax receipts had declined markedly in February 2019, because some of the revenue from that month was not reflected in cash receipts until March 2019. Energy duty revenue also posted a strong gain of 10.6%. Receipts from the solidarity surcharge climbed by 5.7% on the year thanks to growth in revenues from income and corporation tax (which constitute its tax base). Revenue gains were also recorded for electricity duty (up by 11.7%), alcohol duty (up by 2.3%) and aviation tax (up by 5.5%). In contrast, tobacco duty revenue was down on the year by 4.9% in February. Receipts also fell for coffee duty (down by 2.6%) and sparkling wine duty (down by\xc2\xa08.7%). Trends in revenue from other taxes had only a minor impact on the overall results for federal taxes.\nReturn to top\nTaxes accruing to the L\xc3\xa4nder\nRevenue from taxes accruing solely to the L\xc3\xa4nder increased again significantly in February\xc2\xa02020, by 13.5% on the year. This was mainly due to substantial growth in revenue from real property transfer tax (up by 16.4%) and inheritance tax (up by 9.8%). The yield from fire protection tax increased by 6.0%, while receipts from betting and lottery tax were up by 7.8%. Revenue from beer duty was up as well, by 3.7%.\nReturn to top\nBorrowing and guarantees\nDebt trends for the Federation and its special funds (in \xe2\x82\xacm)\nDebt trends for the Federation and its special funds (in \xe2\x82\xacm)\nDebt level\nBorrowing\n(increase)\nDebt repayment\n(decrease)\nDebt level\nChange in debt level\n(balance)\n31 January 2020\nFebruary 2020\nFebruary 2020\n28 February 2020\nFebruary 2020\nBudget borrowing\n1,060,267\n17,535\n-7,096\n1,070,707\n10,439\nbroken down by purpose\nFederal budget\n1,018,388\n17,535\n-7,096\n1,028,827\n10,439\nFinancial Market Stabilisation Fund (loans for expenses pursuant to section 9 (1) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act (Finanzmarkstabilisierungsfondsgesetz)\n22,680\n-\n-\n22,680\n-\nInvestment and Redemption Fund\n19,200\n0\n-\n19,200\n0\nFinancial Market Stabilisation Fund (loans for resolution authorities pursuant to section 9 (5) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act)1\n26,500\n1,500\n-\n28,000\n1,500\nTotal including loans for resolution authorities1\n1,086,767\n19,035\n-7,096\n1,098,707\n11,939\nbroken down by debt type\nFederal securities\n1,075,499\n19,035\n-7,026\n1,087,508\n12,009\nConventional federal securities\n1,004,786\n18,600\n-7,026\n1,016,359\n11,574\n30-year federal bonds\n231,918\n1,347\n-\n233,265\n1,347\n10-year federal bonds\n478,486\n3,723\n-\n482,209\n3,723\nFederal notes\n178,262\n3,451\n-\n181,713\n3,451\nFederal Treasury notes\n94,549\n5,566\n-\n100,115\n5,566\nTreasury discount papers issued by the Federation\n21,570\n4,513\n-7,026\n19,058\n-2,513\nInflation-linked federal securities\n70,308\n436\n-\n70,744\n436\n30-year inflation-linked federal bonds\n8,548\n196\n-\n8,744\n196\n10-year inflation-linked federal bonds\n61,760\n240\n-\n61,999\n240\nOther federal securities\n405\n-\n-\n405\n-\nSecuritised loans\n6,795\n-\n-70\n6,725\n-70\nOther loans and ordinary debts\n4,474\n-\n-\n4,474\n-\nbroken down by maturity\nup to one year\n176,127\n174,613\n-1,513\none to four years\n320,656\n342,992\n22,336\nmore than 4 years\n589,985\n581,101\n-8,884\nAdditional information1\nLiabilities from the indexing of inflation-linked federal securities2\n5,795\n6,052\n257\nReserves in accordance with the Final Payment Financing Act\n(Schlusszahlungsfinanzierungsgesetz)3\n4,573\n4,593\n20\n1Under section 9 (5) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act, the Federal Ministry of Finance is empowered to borrow up to \xe2\x82\xac30bn for the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund so that the Fund can grant loans to resolution authorities for the purpose of refinancing (as per section 8 (10) of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act) assets that they have taken over. Such borrowing is neutral overall in terms of debt, because it replaces the funds that resolution authorities would otherwise have to borrow on the market. However, it does increase the debt level in federal securities.\n2Liabilities resulting from indexing include the amount by which the original issuance price has increased due to inflation between the start date and the specified reference date.\n3In contrast, reserves include only the increases that are noted on coupon payment dates (15 April of every year) (section 4(1) of the Final Payment Financing Act) and on reopening dates for inflation-linked securities (section 4(2) of the Final Payment Financing Act).\nAny discrepancies in totals are due to rounding.\nSource: Federal Ministry of Finance\nGuarantees\nAuthorised amount\nAmount allocated\nas of\n31\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02019\nAmount allocated\nas of\n31\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02018\nin \xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa0bn\nExport credit guarantees\n148.0\n119.4\n120.7\nLoans to foreign debtors, foreign direct investment, EIB loans\n58.0\n42.8\n42.7\nFinancial cooperation projects\n28.5\n25.6\n22.8\nFood stockpiling\n0.7\n0.0\n0.0\nDomestic guarantees\n125.0\n115.8\n104.7\nReturn to top\nCalendar\nPublication schedule1 of the monthly reports\xc2\xa0Monthly reportReporting periodPublication dateApril 2020 issueMarch\xc2\xa0202021 April 2020May 2020 issueApril\xc2\xa0202022 May 2020June 2020 issueMay\xc2\xa0202019 June 2020July 2020 issueJune 202021 July 2020August 2020 issueJuly 202020 August 2020September 2020 issueAugust 202022 September 2020October 2020 issueSeptember 202022 October 2020November 2020 issueOctober 202020 November 2020December 2020 issueNovember 202022 December 2020\n1In accordance with the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s Special Data Dissemination Standard Plus (SDDS Plus); see http://dsbb.imf.org\nSource: Federal Ministry of Finance\nKey dates on the fiscal and economic policy agenda\n16\xe2\x80\x9317 April 2020\nMeeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington, D.C.\n17\xe2\x80\x9319 April 2020\nSpring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, D.C.\n24\xe2\x80\x9325 April 2020\nEurogroup and informal ECOFIN meetings in Zagreb, Croatia\n18\xe2\x80\x9319 May 2020\nEurogroup and ECOFIN Council meetings in Brussels\n11\xe2\x80\x9312 June 2020\nEurogroup and ECOFIN Council meetings in Luxembourg\nClick here for the full schedule (in German)\nMore on this topic\nMonthly report archive\nSubject Logo\nArea Menu\nPublications\n:\nMonthly Report\n:\nOur Brochures\nTechnical Papers\nLaws in English\nMultimedia\nLivestream\nAdditional Information\nOur brochures in German\nGraphics\nPrint this page\nReturn to top\nPage overview\nHome\nIs\xc2\xadsues\nPriority issues\nPublic Finances\nTaxation\nFinancial Markets\nEurope\nStamps\nAbout\nMinister and Senior Leadership\nDirectorates-General\nAdvisory Board\nEvents at the Ministry\nHistory\nVisitors' Service\nDirections\nRe\xc2\xadsources\nPublications\nLaws in English\nMultimedia\nLivestream\nPress\nSpeeches, Interviews and Articles\nPress Releases\nMedia Images\nMedia Contacts\nMetanavigation\nLe\xc2\xadgal No\xc2\xadtice\nPri\xc2\xadva\xc2\xadcy Pol\xc2\xadi\xc2\xadcy\n\xc2\xa9 Federal Ministry of Finance\nVisit the Federal Ministry of Finance on social media and share\nTwitter BMF (Opens\xc2\xa0new\xc2\xa0window)\nInstagram BMF (Opens\xc2\xa0new\xc2\xa0window)\n\xc3\xb6ffnet den YouTube-Kanal des BMF.

The aim is to protect citizens\xe2\x80\x99 health, support businesses, and preserve employment levels and incomes. The Government will step up its intervention to tackle the unfolding of the crisis.\nThe four pillars of the package are:\n1. Strengthening the National Health Care System and the Civil Protection Department\n2. Preserving employment levels and incomes\n3. Pumping a huge amount of liquidity to help businesses and households\n4. Suspending tax payments and providing tax incentives for workers and businesses\n1. Strengthening the National Health Care System and the Civil Protection Department (3.2 billion euro)\nThe Government has mobilized all the needed resources to ensure staffing and tools for the health care system, the civil protection department and law enforcement bodies in order to assist people affected by the disease and prevent, mitigate and contain the epidemic.\nMore specifically, the Government will proceed immediately to hire medical and nursing personnel to reinforce the units of the military health care services, and to involve the private hospitals. Rules have been introduced to allow, if necessary, the requisition of private facilities and properties in order to enhance medical facilities and health care networks across the country.\nThe Government has also streamlined the purchasing procedures for medical protection equipment. This allowed, among other results, the timely acquisition of 5000 assisted ventilation equipment and millions protective masks. Delivery of such devices is currently in progress and will be completed within 45 days.\n2. Preserving employment levels and incomes (around 10.3 billion euro)\nPreserving jobs and incomes is crucial to shield families and businesses from the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.\nTo this end, the Government has allocated 10.3 billion euros to strengthen social safety net, in particular temporary unemployment benefits for employees in every productive sector, including businesses with less than five employees. The purpose is to keep people in employment and avoid firings due to a temporary crisis. This measure is complemented with an allowance of 600 euro for the month of March for self-employed workers \xe2\x80\x93 almost 5 million people who generally do not have access to ordinary social safety nets \xe2\x80\x93 and seasonal workers.\nOther measures in the package include:\nFamilies may apply for a suspension of their mortgage repayment if business shutdowns caused by the pandemic threaten their livelihoods.\nParents may claim up to 600 euro to pay for babysitting. Alternatively, they can apply for an extended parental leave of 12 days at 50% of their salary. In March and April, paid leave granted to people who look after a disabled family member is extended to 12 days per month instead of three days.\nHiring of additional 1000 doctors.\nAdditional resources to pay overtime work to police and security personnel.\nThese measures aim to protect workers\xe2\x80\x99 incomes and, at the same time, allow companies to re-organize the workplace to safeguard employees\xe2\x80\x99 health and safety.\nFurthermore, on Saturday March 14th, the Government, the trade unions, and the employers\xe2\x80\x99 associations signed a Protocol defining a set of guidelines to ensure the maximum health and safety standards for workers who keep working. This also allows to ensure the application of containment measures on the workplace.\nThe implementation of the Protocol is expected to minimize the pandemic\xe2\x80\x99s impact on economic activity while ensuring uniform implementation of safety requirements all over the country, as defined by the health authorities.\n3. Pumping up to 350 billion euro of liquidity to help businesses and households (5.1 billion euro)\nThe government intends to prevent businesses and families from suffering from a collapse of revenues and a sudden lack of liquidity also caused by the credit crunch, as in the financial crisis of 2007-2008.\nTo support credit supply the Government\xe2\x80\x99s plan has allocated additional 5.1 billion euro that will leverage credit up to 350 billion euro to professionals and firms, in particular SMEs and MidCaps, and will top up this amount in order to further increase the guaranteed amount of credit for enterprises of any size.\nThe package consists of the following tools:\nMoratorium on loan repayments for small and medium-sized businesses, including mortgages and overdrafts (increased liquidity by 220 billion euro).\nEnhancement of the SME Guarantee Fund. The size of the Fund has been increased by more than 150% bringing the guaranteed funding from the current 40 billions to over 100 billions.\nIncentives for financial and non-financial companies to transfer non-performing or stranded loans through the conversion of their Deferred Tax Activities into Tax Credits. The intervention will allow businesses to access to additional liquidity and credit for up to 10 billion euro.\nState guarantee for Cassa depositi e prestiti (CDP), which will itself provide additional guarantees and liquidity to banks in order to allow the expansion of financing and liquidity for medium to large enterprises that do not benefit from the SME Guarantee Fund. A guarantee worth 500 million euro is expected to have a multiplier of 20, which can therefore generate new funds up to 10 billion.\nFurther measures to support credit to all firms \xe2\x80\x93 large companies as well \xe2\x80\x93 through the banking channel, by including a guarantee on the first loss and/or subsidised financing, in line with the forthcoming temporary new state aid framework.\n4. Suspending tax payments and providing tax incentives for workers and businesses (1.6 billion euro)\nThe Government has suspended a number of tax payments to help taxpayers, and introduced tax incentives and credits to support the economy. The key measures included in the law-decree are the following:\nTax and social security payments due in March have been suspended for a large number of taxpayers. These include all businesses and self-employed with turnover below 2 million euros, as well as taxpayers belonging to sectors heavily hit by the emergency (e.g. tourism, transportation, restaurants and cafes, movie theaters, amusement parks, organization of fairs and events). Once resumed, these tax payments can be made in up to five instalments. In addition, withholding taxes on the remuneration paid to self-employed taxpayers with turnover below 400.000 euros and without employees have been suspended for the months of March and April.\nTax controls, field audits, coercive collection, litigation and tax compliance obligations have been suspended until June.\nThere are some exceptions, such as the information that intermediaries have to file in order to populate the pre-filled tax returns for year 2019 and the tax payments that have not been suspended.\nTax credit for sanitation. All expenses for sanitation, protection of workers and containment of the contagion benefit from a tax credit of 50% of the expenses incurred (up to a tax credit of 20,000 euro per taxpayer).\nSpecial bonus for employees. A bonus of 100 euros is granted to all employees who keep working with income below 40.000 euros, proportional to the days of presence at the work premises.\nTax credits and deductions for COVID-19 donations: All donations in cash or in kind to support the containment of the contagion are deductible for corporations and generate a 30% tax credit for individuals (up to a tax credit of 20,000 euro per taxpayer).\nTax credit for commercial rents: Stores and small shops which are closed because of the emergency are granted a tax credit equal to 60% of the rent for March.\nAdditional measures in support to Central and Local Public Administrations, including Municipalities are worth 4.5 billion euro.\nImpact on deficit and on public finance sustainability\nThe first package will lead to a net borrowing increase of about 1.1 percentage points of GDP (about 20 billion) in 2020 and to a temporary deviation, already authorized in both houses of the Italian Parliament by absolute majority of their components, from the adjustment path towards the medium-term objective.\nThe overall expenditure, limited to 2020, aims to ensure an increased capability to effectively deal with the extraordinary emergency and they will be treated, due to their nature of one-off expenses, as budget components that do not impact on the structural budget balance, which is a key indicator in national and European fiscal rules.\nThe temporary nature of this intervention will ensure that public finances sustainability is not jeopardized. The extraordinary intervention decided today is based on solid foundations, as evidenced by the excellent budget results achieved in 2019, with a growth in revenues higher than expected and a drop in net borrowing to 1.6% of GDP. It is the lowest deficit in the last twelve years and more than half a percentage point lower than both the 2018 figure and the forecasts formulated in October for the Draft Budgetary Plan. This is the result of policies implemented to fight against tax evasion and of a rigorous, coherent and credible behaviour of the Government, both on the revenues side and in containing public expenditure.\nThe debt-to-GDP ratio stabilized in recent years. The larger deficit needed for emergency interventions will probably lead to an increase in the ratio in 2020. In the next Economic and Financial Document, the Government will present a policy scenario consistent not only with a relaunch strategy for the Italian economy, but also with a declining path of the debt-to-GDP ratio in the three-year programming period and on a longer-term horizon.\nThe European context\nThe measures implemented by the Italian Government are compatible with the European regulatory framework, as the European context has declared to be able to adapt existing rules to new needs by exploiting all the current and potential flexibility of the Stability and Growth Pact and by reviewing the State aid framework, revisioning margins and allowing States to act in a resolute and coordinated manner.\nIn this context, also the ECB strongly supports the commitment of the euro area governments and the European institutions to implement a joint and coordinated political action and adopted a package of monetary policy measures to support liquidity and financing conditions for households, businesses and banks and to help preserving the orderly credit flow to the real economy. Together with the significant monetary policy stimulus already in place, these measures will support liquidity and financing conditions for households, businesses and banks, will help preserving the regular supply of credit to the real economy and ultimately avoid fragmentation of the euro area financial system.\nThe Government is therefore working to ensure the highest degree of coordination and the appropriate level of ambition of the common European response to the Covid-19 crisis. Europe has decided to act and respond swiftly and flexibly to developments as they unfold making use of all instruments necessary to limit the socio-economic consequences of the outbreak. A first set of national as well as common measures have been put together while setting a framework for further actions to respond to developments and to support the economic recovery. In example by making structural funds fully eligible for meeting expenditures to tackle the epidemic crisis. These funds will contribute to the financing of the next package of measures.\nOverall, the Government is determined to do whatever it takes to effectively address the current challenges and to restore confidence and support a rapid recovery. Italy was the first country in Europe in which the epidemic spread and will be the first to emerge from the crisis.\nList of tags\nCoronavirus\nCovid-19\nProtect health, support the economy, preserve employment levels and incomes\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedin\nTelegram\nPrint\nMORE ABOUT MEF\nThis is footer section: it contains all the useful site entries\nMap\nSite structure\nItalian version\nDepartments\nDepartment of the Treasury\nThe State General Accounting Department\nDepartment of Finance\nDepartment of General Administration, Personnel, and Services\nAgencies\nRevenue and Land Registry Agency\nCustoms and Monopolies Agency\nItalian Public Property Agency\nRevenue-Collection Agency\nContacts\nPress Office\nFeed RSS\nPress releases\nSpeeches and Interviews\nLatest published\nFollow us on\nLinkedIn MEF profileProfilo Linkedin del Mef\nMEF Telegram profileProfilo Telegram del Mef\nMEF YouTube channelCanale YouTube del Mef\nMEF Instagram profileProfilo Instagram del Mef\nMEF Flickr profileProfilo Flickr del Mef\nMEF Twitter profileProfilo Twitter del Mef\nItalian Government \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0|\nMinistry of Economy and Finance\nVia Venti Settembre, 97 - 00187 Roma - Italia\n+39\n06476111\nProfilo Linkedin del Mef\nProfilo Telegram del Mef\nCanale YouTube del Mef\nProfilo Instagram del Mef\nProfilo Flickr del Mef\nProfilo Twitter del Mef\nShortcut keys\n\xc3\x97\nCTRL +\nALT +\n0\nAccess the easy browsing menu\nCTRL +\nALT +\n1\nGo to browsing menu\nCTRL +\nALT +\n2\nGo to the section \xe2\x80\x9cHighlighted\xe2\x80\x9d\nCTRL +\nALT +\n3\nGo to the section \xe2\x80\x9cPress Room\xe2\x80\x9d\nCTRL +\nALT +\n4\nGo to the section \xe2\x80\x9cFocus\xe2\x80\x9d\nCTRL +\nALT +\n5\nGo to the section \xe2\x80\x9cLatest publications\xe2\x80\x9d\nCTRL +\nALT +\n8\nGo to the section \xe2\x80\x9cMore about MEF\xe2\x80\x9d\nCTRL +\nALT +\nH\nGo to the home page\nCTRL +\nALT +\nR\nSearch\nCTRL +\nALT +\nN\nGo to site update\nCTRL +\nALT +\nT\nGo to ticker news\nCTRL +\nALT +\nG\nGo to site guide\nCTRL +\nALT +\nC\nGo to contents\nClose\nPrint\nEasy browsing\n\xc3\x97\nThe main contents are hardly ever the first thing we see about a webpage.

Este nuevo grupo de medidas se articula en tres bloques: en primer lugar, apoyo a los trabajadores, las familias, los consumidores, los aut\xc3\xb3nomos y los colectivos m\xc3\xa1s vulnerables, de forma que se pueda aliviar su situaci\xc3\xb3n financiera y sus gastos fijos, y preservar as\xc3\xad una renta m\xc3\xadnima.\nEn segundo lugar, se impulsan iniciativas para sostener el tejido productivo y el empleo, y facilitar la futura recuperaci\xc3\xb3n de la actividad; y, en tercer t\xc3\xa9rmino, se adoptan medidas de flexibilizaci\xc3\xb3n de diversas actividades y procesos de la Administraci\xc3\xb3n.\nFinalmente, se han reforzado algunas de las medidas adoptadas en el Real Decreto- Ley 8/2020, aprobado el pasado 17 de marzo, adem\xc3\xa1s de extenderse la duraci\xc3\xb3n de las mismas hasta un mes despu\xc3\xa9s del final del estado de alarma.\nSe trata de medidas que refuerzan el empe\xc3\xb1o del Gobierno ""de que nadie se quede atr\xc3\xa1s"", tal y como ha recordado la ministra de Hacienda y Portavoz, Mar\xc3\xada Jes\xc3\xbas Montero y que permiten ""reforzar el escudo social frente al coronavirus"", como ha explicado el vicepresidente de Derechos Sociales y Agenda 2030, Pablo Iglesias.\nMoratoria de alquileres\nEl primer bloque de medidas tiene como objetivo apoyar a las personas que no puedan pagar sus alquileres por encontrarse en situaci\xc3\xb3n de vulnerabilidad por el COVID-19 y no tengan alternativa habitacional. En primer t\xc3\xa9rmino, se suspenden los desahucios durante seis meses desde la entrada en vigor del estado de alarma.\nEn segundo lugar, se implanta la renovaci\xc3\xb3n autom\xc3\xa1tica de los contratos de alquiler que venzan en los tres meses siguientes a la entrada en vigor de esta norma. Esta pr\xc3\xb3rroga ser\xc3\xa1 de seis meses y en ella se mantendr\xc3\xa1n los t\xc3\xa9rminos y condiciones del contrato en vigor.\nEn tercer lugar, se establece una moratoria autom\xc3\xa1tica en el pago de su renta para aquellos arrendatarios en situaci\xc3\xb3n de vulnerabilidad cuyo arrendador sea un gran tenedor de vivienda, tanto p\xc3\xbablico como privado, incluido el Fondo Social de Vivienda de las entidades financieras. Se entiende como tal a quien posea m\xc3\xa1s de diez inmuebles.\nLa moratoria en el pago de la renta se prolongar\xc3\xa1 mientras dure el estado de alarma o mientras persista la situaci\xc3\xb3n de vulnerabilidad, con un m\xc3\xa1ximo de cuatro meses. Una vez superada dicha situaci\xc3\xb3n, el inquilino devolver\xc3\xa1 la cuota o cuotas no pagadas a lo largo de un periodo no superior a tres a\xc3\xb1os, sin que pueda aplic\xc3\xa1rsele ning\xc3\xban tipo de penalizaci\xc3\xb3n ni intereses.\nEn cuarto lugar, se regula la moratoria para el caso en el que el arrendador no sea un gran tenedor de inmuebles, algo que sucede en el 85% de los casos. En estas circunstancias, el inquilino, siempre que se encuentre en situaci\xc3\xb3n de vulnerabilidad, podr\xc3\xa1 solicitar un aplazamiento en el pago de su renta. El arrendador tendr\xc3\xa1 siete d\xc3\xadas para aceptarlo, proponer una alternativa o rechazarlo.\nEn el caso de que no haya un acuerdo, el inquilino tendr\xc3\xa1 acceso a un programa de ayudas transitorias de financiaci\xc3\xb3n a coste cero con aval del Estado. El inquilino podr\xc3\xa1 solicitar un cr\xc3\xa9dito finalista, directamente pagado al arrendador, por importe de hasta seis mensualidades de la renta de alquiler, a devolver en un periodo m\xc3\xa1ximo de diez a\xc3\xb1os. Este cr\xc3\xa9dito no tendr\xc3\xa1 inter\xc3\xa9s, ser\xc3\xa1 concedido por las entidades de cr\xc3\xa9dito y contar\xc3\xa1 con el aval del Estado, a trav\xc3\xa9s del Instituto de Cr\xc3\xa9dito Oficial (ICO), que firmar\xc3\xa1 el correspondiente acuerdo con el Ministerio de Transportes, Movilidad y Agenda Urbana.\nPara personas que tengan problemas m\xc3\xa1s permanentes para el pago del alquiler, se establece tambi\xc3\xa9n un nuevo programa de ayudas directas al alquiler sobre vivienda habitual y que podr\xc3\xa1n ser a\xc3\xb1adidas a las citadas anteriormente.\nLa norma incorpora un programa espec\xc3\xadfico para v\xc3\xadctimas de violencia de g\xc3\xa9nero, personas sin hogar y otras especialmente vulnerables, a fin de dotarles de una soluci\xc3\xb3n habitacional inmediata. Se establece una ayuda de hasta 600 euros al mes, que puede elevarse en casos justificados hasta 900 euros, siempre con un l\xc3\xadmite del 100% de la renta del inmueble. Y se a\xc3\xb1aden otros 200 euros para la atenci\xc3\xb3n de los gastos de mantenimiento, comunidad y suministros b\xc3\xa1sicos, con un l\xc3\xadmite del 100% de los mismos.\nSe extiende la moratoria hipotecaria\nEn materia de vivienda, se clarifican aspectos relacionados con la moratoria hipotecaria regulada en el RDL8/2020. As\xc3\xad, el plazo de suspensi\xc3\xb3n pasa de uno a tres meses; se adapta la acreditaci\xc3\xb3n de vulnerabilidad a la situaci\xc3\xb3n derivada del estado de alarma, siendo suficiente en estas circunstancias con una declaraci\xc3\xb3n responsable del beneficiario sobre su situaci\xc3\xb3n; y se clarifica que las cuotas suspendidas no se abonan al finalizar la suspensi\xc3\xb3n, sino que todos los pagos restantes se posponen por id\xc3\xa9ntico periodo. Tambi\xc3\xa9n se a\xc3\xb1ade a los aut\xc3\xb3nomos entre los colectivos que pueden beneficiarse de esta moratoria.\nCon la misma filosof\xc3\xada que la moratoria en el pago de alquileres o de hipotecas, el Real Decreto-Ley aprobado hoy establece la posibilidad de una moratoria en los cr\xc3\xa9ditos y pr\xc3\xa9stamos no hipotecarios que mantengan las personas en situaci\xc3\xb3n de vulnerabilidad, incluyendo los cr\xc3\xa9ditos al consumo.\nFinalmente, se habilita a las corporaciones locales para que utilicen el super\xc3\xa1vit de ejercicios anteriores para adoptar medidas de apoyo a colectivos vulnerables en materia de vivienda.\nApoyo en suministros b\xc3\xa1sicos\nOtro de los ejes en los que ahonda el nuevo paquete de medidas tiene que ver con garantizar los suministros b\xc3\xa1sicos a m\xc3\xa1s hogares. As\xc3\xad, se ampl\xc3\xada el colectivo de potenciales perceptores del bono social el\xc3\xa9ctrico, al que podr\xc3\xa1n acogerse de forma excepcional las personas que se hayan visto afectadas por medidas de regulaci\xc3\xb3n de empleo de sus empresas o, en el caso de aut\xc3\xb3nomos, haber cesado su actividad o visto reducidos sus ingresos en m\xc3\xa1s de un 75%.\nAdem\xc3\xa1s, en un contexto en el que, por una mayor permanencia en el hogar derivada de las medidas de contenci\xc3\xb3n y por el desarrollo en el mismo de actividades profesionales que, normalmente, se realizan fuera de la vivienda habitual, se establecen medidas para garantizar la continuidad de los suministros energ\xc3\xa9ticos y de agua en el hogar, prohibi\xc3\xa9ndose su suspensi\xc3\xb3n por motivos distintos a la seguridad del suministro.\nNuevas ayudas sociales\nSiguiendo con la idea trasladada por el Gobierno de no dejar a nadie atr\xc3\xa1s en esta crisis, se establecen nuevas prestaciones para colectivos que no ten\xc3\xadan derecho a las mismas.\nSe crea un subsidio extraordinario temporal para empleadas del hogar que hayan visto su jornada reducida o su contrato extinguido como consecuencia del COVID-19. El importe de esta prestaci\xc3\xb3n, que tiene car\xc3\xa1cter retroactivo si la causa es la actual crisis sanitaria, ser\xc3\xa1 el equivalente a un 70% de la base reguladora de la empleada. Ser\xc3\xa1 compatible con el mantenimiento de otras actividades, sin que, en ese caso, la suma de retribuciones pueda exceder el importe del Salario M\xc3\xadnimo Interprofesional.\nAsimismo, se establece que las personas que tuviesen un contrato temporal de duraci\xc3\xb3n de al menos dos meses que se hubiese extinguido tras la declaraci\xc3\xb3n del estado de alarma y que no alcancen el periodo de cotizaci\xc3\xb3n m\xc3\xadnimo para percibir una prestaci\xc3\xb3n por desempleo pueden percibir un subsidio extraordinario equivalente al 80% del importe mensual del Indicador P\xc3\xbablico de Renta de Efectos M\xc3\xbaltiples (Iprem), estableciendo requisitos de acceso en funci\xc3\xb3n de la situaci\xc3\xb3n de rentas del hogar familiar\nOtras medidas de apoyo a las personas\nPara aliviar las necesidades de liquidez de los ciudadanos, se ampl\xc3\xadan los supuestos en los que se pueden rescatar las aportaciones realizadas a planes de pensiones, de forma que podr\xc3\xa1n recurrir a las mismas las personas que est\xc3\xa9n inmersas en un expediente de regulaci\xc3\xb3n temporal de empleo y los aut\xc3\xb3nomos que hayan cesado su actividad como consecuencia de los efectos del COVID-19.\nSe adoptan diferentes medidas de protecci\xc3\xb3n al consumidor en los contratos de compraventa de bienes y de prestaci\xc3\xb3n de servicios, sean o no de tracto sucesivo, cuya ejecuci\xc3\xb3n sea imposible como consecuencia de la aplicaci\xc3\xb3n de las medidas adoptadas en la declaraci\xc3\xb3n del estado de alarma. En estos casos, los consumidores podr\xc3\xa1n ejercer el derecho a resolver el contrato durante un plazo de 14 d\xc3\xadas.\nEn los contratos de tracto sucesivo, se paralizar\xc3\xa1 el cobro de nuevas cuotas hasta que el servicio pueda volver a prestarse con normalidad, sin que esto suponga la rescisi\xc3\xb3n del contrato.\nEn cuanto a servicios prestados por varios proveedores, caso, por ejemplo, de los viajes combinados, el consumidor podr\xc3\xa1 optar por solicitar el reembolso o hacer uso del bono que le entregar\xc3\xa1 el organizador o, en su caso, el minorista. Dicho bono lo podr\xc3\xa1 utilizar en el plazo de un a\xc3\xb1o desde la conclusi\xc3\xb3n del estado de alarma. En caso de no utilizarse durante ese periodo, el consumidor podr\xc3\xa1 ejercer el derecho de reembolso\nEn el \xc3\xa1mbito del sector de telecomunicaciones, la norma matiza que la suspensi\xc3\xb3n de la portabilidad solo afecta a aquellas operaciones en las que exista necesidad de los usuarios de desplazarse f\xc3\xadsicamente a tiendas o de que se realicen intervenciones f\xc3\xadsicas en su domicilio, excepto en casos de fuerza mayor\nAdem\xc3\xa1s, y para evitar que el consumidor se pueda ver perjudicado por la suspensi\xc3\xb3n de las operaciones de portabilidad, se establece que los usuarios no puedan ver sus tarifas incrementadas durante el tiempo en que no puedan solicitar un cambio de compa\xc3\xb1\xc3\xada.\nFinalmente, en un contexto en el que las actividades de ocio est\xc3\xa1n muy afectadas por las medidas de contenci\xc3\xb3n derivadas del estado de alarma, tambi\xc3\xa9n se establecen limitaciones en la publicidad y en las actividades de promoci\xc3\xb3n de determinadas actividades de juego online.\nApoyo al tejido productivo\nCon el fin de aliviar la situaci\xc3\xb3n financiera de empresas y aut\xc3\xb3nomos afectados por la actual crisis, se habilita a la Tesorer\xc3\xada General de la Seguridad Social a conceder de forma excepcional moratorias en el pago de las cotizaciones sociales.\nEn el caso de los aut\xc3\xb3nomos, se establece que los que sean beneficiarios de la prestaci\xc3\xb3n por cese de actividad podr\xc3\xa1n abonar fuera de plazo y sin recargo las cotizaciones del mes de marzo correspondientes a los d\xc3\xadas previos a la declaraci\xc3\xb3n del estado de alarma.\nSe permite que empresas y aut\xc3\xb3nomos que no tengan en vigor aplazamientos de pago de deudas con la Seguridad Social puedan solicitar hasta el 30 de junio de 2020 el aplazamiento del pago de las deudas que deban ingresar entre abril y junio de 2020 sin que se aplique ning\xc3\xban inter\xc3\xa9s.\nPara el acceso a la prestaci\xc3\xb3n extraordinaria por cese de actividad, se adapta la norma para contemplar la situaci\xc3\xb3n de determinados colectivos que tienen un alto grado de estacionalidad, como el agrario, el de la cultura, los vinculados a acontecimientos como la Semana Santa u otros.\nSe facilita, asimismo, la realizaci\xc3\xb3n de todos los tr\xc3\xa1mites relativos a aplazamientos en el pago de deudas, moratorias o devoluciones de ingresos indebidos a trav\xc3\xa9s del Sistema RED de comunicaci\xc3\xb3n electr\xc3\xb3nica.\nAdem\xc3\xa1s, se establecen diferentes medidas para que los aut\xc3\xb3nomos y las empresas que se hayan visto afectados por el COVID-19 puedan flexibilizar el pago de suministros b\xc3\xa1sicos como la luz, el agua o el gas, llegando incluso a la posibilidad de suspender su pago. Las cantidades adeudadas se abonar\xc3\xa1n como m\xc3\xa1ximo en los seis meses siguientes a la finalizaci\xc3\xb3n del estado de alarma.\nLa norma establece tambi\xc3\xa9n una serie de medidas que, igual que en reales decretos- ley pasados, persiguen preservar al m\xc3\xa1ximo el empleo. En este sentido, se adaptan los compromisos de mantenimiento del empleo durante el plazo de seis meses fijados en el RDL 8/2020 a las particularidades de determinados sectores, en particular las vinculadas al mundo de la cultura, atendiendo a su variabilidad y alineamiento con eventos concretos.\nTambi\xc3\xa9n se flexibilizan los procedimientos de las convocatorias de pr\xc3\xa9stamos o ayudas de la Secretar\xc3\xada General de Industria y de la Pyme. En este sentido, las garant\xc3\xadas para nuevos pr\xc3\xa9stamos en proceso de resoluci\xc3\xb3n podr\xc3\xa1n presentarse una vez finalice el estado de alarma.\nAsimismo, se podr\xc3\xa1n solicitar modificaciones en los cuadros de amortizaci\xc3\xb3n de pr\xc3\xa9stamos ya concedidos a proyectos industriales. Se establecen criterios de graduaci\xc3\xb3n en el cumplimiento de programas financiados por la citada Secretar\xc3\xada General...\nSe ampl\xc3\xada en 60 millones de euros la dotaci\xc3\xb3n para CERSA (Compa\xc3\xb1\xc3\xada Espa\xc3\xb1ola de Reafianzamiento), con el fin de que pueda avalar un mayor n\xc3\xbamero de operaciones.\nSe habilita al ICEX para la devoluci\xc3\xb3n a las empresas que hayan incurrido en gastos no recuperables por las cuotas pagadas para la participaci\xc3\xb3n en ferias u otras actividades de promoci\xc3\xb3n internacional que hayan sido convocadas por la instituci\xc3\xb3n y se hayan visto canceladas, aplazadas o afectadas por el COVID-19.\nSe suspende, durante un periodo de un a\xc3\xb1o y sin necesidad de solicitud previa, el pago de intereses y amortizaciones de los cr\xc3\xa9ditos concedidos por la Secretar\xc3\xada de Estado de Turismo.\nSe incluye al CDTI entre los organismos que podr\xc3\xa1n agilizar las ayudas y aportaciones al sector empresarial, con el fin de fomentar la innovaci\xc3\xb3n en la lucha contra la pandemia, as\xc3\xad como garantizar el adecuado funcionamiento del tejido empresarial. Se permitir\xc3\xa1 as\xc3\xad tanto la r\xc3\xa1pida financiaci\xc3\xb3n de prototipos como poder disponer la industrializaci\xc3\xb3n de productos sanitarios considerados de urgencia.\nPor otro lado, se introduce flexibilidad en la comercializaci\xc3\xb3n de combustibles, dado el descenso del consumo y la menor rotaci\xc3\xb3n de los tanques de almacenamiento sobre lo previsto, de forma que se permite retrasar la fecha de inicio de comercializaci\xc3\xb3n de gasolinas con especificaci\xc3\xb3n estival, pudi\xc3\xa9ndose vender hasta el 30 de junio de 2020 gasolinas cuya presi\xc3\xb3n de vapor y destilado presente unos l\xc3\xadmites comprendidos entre el l\xc3\xadmite m\xc3\xadnimo de verano y el m\xc3\xa1ximo de invierno.\nY se ampl\xc3\xada en dos meses desde la finalizaci\xc3\xb3n del estado de alarma los permisos de acceso y conexi\xc3\xb3n a las redes el\xc3\xa9ctricas establecidos en la Ley 24/2013 del Sector El\xc3\xa9ctrico, con el fin de dar seguridad jur\xc3\xaddica a los promotores de proyectos de generaci\xc3\xb3n el\xc3\xa9ctrica, de los que dependen cuantiosas inversiones imprescindibles para el cumplimiento de los objetivos de penetraci\xc3\xb3n de nuevas renovables.\nOtras medidas\nEl Real Decreto-Ley permite que los empleados p\xc3\xbablicos, sin modificaci\xc3\xb3n de sus circunstancias laborales, puedan realizar tareas distintas a las de su puesto de trabajo y apoyar voluntariamente aquellas \xc3\xa1reas y actividades de car\xc3\xa1cter sanitario, sociosanitario, de empleo, para la protecci\xc3\xb3n de colectivos vulnerables y aquellas otras que requieran un refuerzo en materia de personal como consecuencia de la situaci\xc3\xb3n provocada por el COVID-19.\nDel mismo modo, se habilita a que el personal sanitario jubilado pueda retornar al trabajo, compatibilizando su actividad con la percepci\xc3\xb3n de su pensi\xc3\xb3n.\nPor otro lado, se permite que los ingresos derivados dela cotizaci\xc3\xb3n por formaci\xc3\xb3n profesional puedan aplicarse a la financiaci\xc3\xb3n de cualquiera de las prestaciones y acciones del sistema de protecci\xc3\xb3n por desempleo, incluyendo, de esta manera, finalidades m\xc3\xa1s amplias que la mera formaci\xc3\xb3n.\nDadas las actuales circunstancias, se concede a las fundaciones bancarias que tuviesen un plan de desinversi\xc3\xb3n ya aprobado por el Banco de Espa\xc3\xb1a ampliar hasta en dos a\xc3\xb1os el plazo con el que contaran.

And the Agency understands that those measures may have consequences for\xc2\xa0the participation of students, pupils, volunteers and others in Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps mobility.\nThe current situation means that certain participants are either unable to travel from their home base, or are unable to return there from their host location. This uncertainty is also prompting some parents not to allow their children to travel.\nTo respond to these uncertainties, we are applying the maximum flexibility we can in the implementation of the programme, within the limits of the applicable legal framework.\nThe Agency will follow the guidance issued by the Commission to the Erasmus+ National Agencies: the beneficiaries can invoke the ""force majeure""\xc2\xa0clauses. This will allow the Agency to assess the possibility to accept additional costs up to a maximum grant amount. It may also enable the Agency to postpone the planned activities.\nWe are monitoring this situation very closely and will adopt, under the guidance of the Commission, any additional measure that may become necessary.\n\xe2\x80\xb9 Coronavirus: Consequences for Erasmus Mundus Projects\nup\nCoronavirus: Q&A concerning Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps activities \xe2\x80\xba\nLog in to post comments\nLatest Erasmus+ News\nNews feed: Receive updates in real-time!\nNews | Erasmus+ | 08/04/2020 - 08:45\nCoronavirus outbreak \xe2\x80\x93 deadlines for European Policy Experimentations applications extended\nCoronavirus outbreak \xe2\x80\x93 deadlines for European Policy Experimentations applications extended\nRead more\nNews | Erasmus+ | 03/04/2020 - 11:30\nCoronavirus: Q&A concerning Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps activities\nThe European Commission published Q&A concerning Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRead more\nNews | Erasmus+ | 02/04/2020 - 16:30\nHow is Covid-19 affecting schools in Europe?\nNew Eurydice publication\nRead more\nNews | About EACEA | 25/03/2020 - 16:30\nCoronavirus: Implications for the implementation of programmes managed by EACEA\nMessage to the attention of beneficiaries/contractors/experts\nRead more\nNews | Erasmus+ | 24/03/2020 - 11:45\nResults for the Civil Society Cooperation \xe2\x80\x93 Youth action now published \xe2\x80\x93 call for proposals EACEA/45/2019\nNew selection results\nRead more\nAll News\nProgrammes\nErasmus +\nCreative Europe\nEurope for Citizens\nEuropean Solidarity Corps\nIntra-Africa\nEU Aid Volunteers\nNational Policies Platform\nProgrammes 2007-2013\nOnline application tools\ne-Forms\nFunding & Tender opportunity portal\nOur partners\nDirectorate-General for Education and Culture\nDirectorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology\nDirectorate-General for Justice and Consumers\nDirectorate-General European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations\nAbout\nAbout EACEA\nDocument register\nWorking for EACEA\nWorking as an expert\nCalls for tenders\nVisual identity\nLegal Remedies\nVisiting EACEA\nContacts'"

The closure of higher education institutions as well as the broader measures undertaken in many EU and non-EU countries to restrict mobility of citizens and increase social distancing hamper the regular implementation of most of the ongoing or planned Erasmus Mundus activities.\nThe Commission and the Agency are acutely aware of the difficulties faced by project beneficiaries in this respect. Our foremost concern, that we know you share, is the safety and protection of all programme participants.\nThis note aims to provide clarifications and general recommendations in order to support consortia in managing these exceptional circumstances.\nThis unprecedented situation is having a huge impact on most stakeholders and participants: Erasmus Mundus mobility participants, students and scholars, who are experiencing a varying degree of disruption during their mobility, or had either to cancel or postpone their planned mobility period. We ask all consortia to be as flexible and pragmatic as possible to minimise any negative impact on their participants and, as regards students and scholars, to help facilitating the achievements of their learning outcomes/teaching assignment indicated in their agreements. This can be done through alternative means such as digital tools for example, in particular for those students/scholars who already started their programme/activities.\nMany host institutions are enabling mobile students/scholars to continue their studies/assignments remotely by either offering them to follow/offer courses online or by doing assignments. In some cases, students/scholars have returned to their home countries but continue to follow courses/doing assignments at the host institutions through various solutions. Given these exceptional circumstances, please note that the Agency will consider any such remote studying arrangements as eligible, provided they contribute to achieving the learning outcomes/assignments. We also hope all consortia will be as flexible as possible in order to allow students to have all the ECTS obtained through such remote studying arrangements fully recognised.\nWe are aware that many institutions, organisations and international relations offices are now closed or are working with a very limited capacity. We encourage all consortia to make sure that Erasmus Mundus participants in mobility, students and scholars, are well informed about where they can access information about the situation in each country and where they can turn to for support if they are temporarily not able to reach the international relations office of their sending or receiving organisations and institutions due to the closings.\nIn the most serious situations, e.g. where repatriation is needed, consortia are invited, whenever possible, to facilitate contacts with embassies and authorities of the home country.\nAs the Erasmus Mundus consortia have to submit to the Agency the list of selected students by the deadline of 15 April 2020, the Agency accepts to delay the submission until 31 May 2020.\nAs a matter of principle, please note that partner institutions must collect and keep the relevant documentation which might be needed at a later stage to prove/justify any decision taken having an impact on the implementation of the project (notably from a financial point of view).\nFor further information or clarifications, please do not hesitate to contact the Agency: EACEA-EM-Consortia@ec.europa.eu\n\xe2\x80\xb9 Coronavirus outbreak \xe2\x80\x93 deadlines for European Policy Experimentations applications extended\nup\nCoronavirus: Consequences for Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps mobility activities \xe2\x80\xba\nLog in to post comments\nLatest Erasmus+ News\nNews feed: Receive updates in real-time!\nNews | Erasmus+ | 08/04/2020 - 08:45\nCoronavirus outbreak \xe2\x80\x93 deadlines for European Policy Experimentations applications extended\nCoronavirus outbreak \xe2\x80\x93 deadlines for European Policy Experimentations applications extended\nRead more\nNews | Erasmus+ | 03/04/2020 - 11:30\nCoronavirus: Q&A concerning Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps activities\nThe European Commission published Q&A concerning Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRead more\nNews | Erasmus+ | 02/04/2020 - 16:30\nHow is Covid-19 affecting schools in Europe?\nNew Eurydice publication\nRead more\nNews | About EACEA | 25/03/2020 - 16:30\nCoronavirus: Implications for the implementation of programmes managed by EACEA\nMessage to the attention of beneficiaries/contractors/experts\nRead more\nNews | Erasmus+ | 24/03/2020 - 11:45\nResults for the Civil Society Cooperation \xe2\x80\x93 Youth action now published \xe2\x80\x93 call for proposals EACEA/45/2019\nNew selection results\nRead more\nAll News\nProgrammes\nErasmus +\nCreative Europe\nEurope for Citizens\nEuropean Solidarity Corps\nIntra-Africa\nEU Aid Volunteers\nNational Policies Platform\nProgrammes 2007-2013\nOnline application tools\ne-Forms\nFunding & Tender opportunity portal\nOur partners\nDirectorate-General for Education and Culture\nDirectorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology\nDirectorate-General for Justice and Consumers\nDirectorate-General European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations\nAbout\nAbout EACEA\nDocument register\nWorking for EACEA\nWorking as an expert\nCalls for tenders\nVisual identity\nLegal Remedies\nVisiting EACEA\nContacts'"

Fisheries and aquaculture have been hit particularly hard by significant market disruptions, including from mandatory restaurant closures.\nThe information note provides details to Member States about support measures that are available immediately and that can be used without delay. There are a number of options, both under the current rules of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the newly adopted Temporary Framework for State aid. The new framework, adopted on 19 March 2020, allows Member States to support affected fishermen and women and aquaculture producers by allowing aid up to a level of \xe2\x82\xac120,000 per undertaking through direct grants, repayable advances or tax advantages.\nMoreover, the note provides guidance for measures that will become available also for the fisheries and aquaculture sector after the entry into force of the coronavirus emergency response package. This package was proposed by the Commission on 13 March and is currently being considered by\xc2\xa0the European Parliament and the Council.\nIn addition to the above measures, the European Commission continues to investigate other options to support the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in these difficult times. The Commission, therefore, remains in close contact with professional organisations, as well as the Member States\xe2\x80\x99 authorities and the European Parliament.\nFactsheet\nInformation note\n/fisheries/file/f-twitter256-32png_enf-twitter_256-32.png\nAlt Text\n:\ntwitter icon\nTitle Text\n:\ntwitter icon\n/fisheries/file/backgroundicon1gif_enbackground_icon1.gif\nSearch\nSearch\nSearch\nSearch\nSearch all news\nPublications\nNewsletter\nBrochures\nLinks\nEU press room\nEU events\nFisheries\nFollow us:\nRSS \xc2\xa0Twitter \xc2\xa0Facebook\nNewsletter Contact Links\nEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission website\nFollow the European Commission\xc2\xa0Facebook\nTwitter\nOther social networks\nEuropean UnionEuropean Union\nEU institutions\nAbout the Commission's new web presence Language policy Resources for partners Cookies Privacy policy Legal notice Brexit content disclaimer Contact"""

National, regional and local communities are on the frontline in countering the disease. Solidarity and responsibility across our societies and between Member States will be key to overcome this challenge. The benefit of collective and coordinated action as a community outweighs individual and parcelled responses. We have to take action to contain the spread of the virus and mitigate its impact to prevent straining public healthcare while reinforcing the responsiveness of our systems and to mitigate the considerable knock on effects on our economies.\nThe Commission has, therefore, launched a Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII) to mobilise cohesion policy to flexibly respond to the rapidly emerging needs in the most exposed sectors, such as healthcare, SMEs and labour markets, and help the most affected territories in Member States and their citizens. To this effect, the European Commission made a series of proposals on 13 March 2020 to amend legislation that will allow Member States to benefit from more financial back-up and targeted assistance.\nThe European Parliament voted almost unanimously in favour of the Commission proposals on 26 March. The Council has finally adopted the package on 30 March 2020. It enters into force on 1 April 2020.\nThe firepower\nThanks to the Initiative, Member States can immediately address three key priorities in the fight against the current emergency and its economic consequences: spending on healthcare, support to short time work schemes, and support to the SMEs working capital.\nTo make this money available, the Commission is proposing to mobilise quickly cash reserves from the EU funds. This will provide immediate liquidity to Member States' budgets and will help to frontload the yet unallocated \xe2\x82\xac37 billion of cohesion policy funding within the 2014-2020 cohesion policy programmes, thus providing a much needed boost to economic investments.\nThe Commission is also making all Coronavirus crisis related expenditure eligible under cohesion policy rules. It will also be applying the rules for cohesion spending with maximum flexibility, thus enabling Member States to use the funds to finance crisis-related action. This also means providing greater flexibility for countries to reallocate financial resources, making sure the money is spent in the areas of greatest need: the health sector, support for SMEs, and the labour market.\nThe EU Solidarity Fund will provide additional assistance of up to \xe2\x82\xac800 million to the worst affected countries in order to alleviate the financial burden of the immediate response measures.\nLetters from Commissioner Ferreira and Commissioner Schmit to EU countries\nOn 18 March 2020 Commissioners Elisa Ferreira responsible for Cohesion and Reforms and Nicolas Schmit responsible for Jobs and Social Rights have sent letters to all the EU countries to inform them on the individual support they can receive under the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII).\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nFurthermore, following the entry into force of these possibilities, the European Commission has proposed a new set of measures to mobilise support against COVID19 \xe2\x80\x93 the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+), in order to introduce extraordinary flexibility and allow that all non-utilised support from the European Structural and Investment Funds can be mobilised to the fullest. This new package is currently under discussion at the European Parliament and the Council, in view of a swift adoption\nThe work of the country teams\nAt technical level, the work with the relevant national administrations has already started and is progressing very well. The Commission has established a Task Force to serve as a one-stop shop for questions about the implementation of the initiative. A digital platform for swift exchange on their questions is now up and running and already counts over 300 questions that are promptly treated and replied. The dedicated country teams have also started their work of identifying specific needs and designing the appropriate measures, also involving State Aid, EU financial rules and support from the European Investment Bank. Contacts are already taking place in order to take, swiftly, all the necessary steps.\nRegional Policy\nStay connected:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGoogle+\nYoutube\nFlickr\nRegio Network\nContact\nSitemap\nFAQ\nEuropean Commission\nFollow the European Commission\nFacebook\nTwitter\nOther social media\nEuropean Union\nEU institutions\nEuropean Union\nAbout the Commission's new web presence\nResources for partners\nCookies\nLegal notice\nBrexit content disclaimer\nContact"""

situation and will fulfill our obligation to deliver the 2020 Census counts to the President of the United States.\nIt has never been easier to respond on your own, whether online, over the phone or by mail\xe2\x80\x94all without having to meet a census taker. \xc2\xa0To date, over 2 million households have already responded online, and the Census Bureau is ready for you to do the same. \xc2\xa0If you do, there will be no need for census takers to knock on your door.\nThat said, the 2020 Census is adaptable and equipped with an approximate $2 billion dollar contingency budget for circumstances like the COVID-19 outbreak.\nWhen a community, facility or service organization is\xc2\xa0impacted by a COVID-19 outbreak we will adapt\xc2\xa0our plans\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0to make sure we are getting the same population counted another way.\nWe will share information about any change in operations with\xc2\xa0Congress,\xc2\xa0state and local authorities, community partners and the media. We will also work with community partners to continue to encourage self-response through the end of the nonresponse follow-up phase.\xc2\xa0Currently, the planned completion date is July 31- but that can and will be adjusted if necessary as the situation dictates in order to achieve a complete and accurate count.\nAs we continue to assess the current situation, we will always make decisions that ensure the health and safety of our staff and the public in consultation with public health authorities.\nLeadership\nWilbur Ross\nShare this page\nReturn to top\nExplore\nIssues\nNews\nData and reports\nWork with us\nAbout us\nOur mission\nStrategic plan\nBureaus and offices\nPrivacy program\nGet in touch\nContact us\nStaff directory\nOpen government\nFOIA\nExplore\nIssues\nNews\nData and reports\nWork with us\nAbout us\nOur mission\nStrategic plan\nBureaus and offices\nPrivacy program\nGet in touch\nContact us\nStaff directory\nOpen government\nFOIA\nU.S. Department of Commerce\n1401 Constitution Ave NW\nWashington, DC 20230\nSign up for email updates\nTo sign up for updates or to access your subscriber preferences, please enter your contact information below.\nEmail Address\nArchives\nAccessibility\nAgency Financial Report\nComment policy\nDigital strategy\nInformation quality\nNo Fear Act\nInspector General\nPlain language\nPrivacy policy\nPayment Integrity\nUSA.gov\nWhistleblower Protection\nWhiteHouse.gov"""

This would provide a\n75-per-cent wage subsidy to eligible employers for up to 12 weeks, retroactive\nto March 15, 2020.\nThis wage subsidy aims to prevent\nfurther job losses, encourage employers to re-hire workers previously laid off\nas a result of COVID-19, and help better position Canadian companies and other employers\nto more easily resume normal operations following the crisis. While the\nGovernment has designed the proposed wage subsidy to provide generous and\ntimely financial support to employers, it has done so with the expectation that\nemployers will do their part by using the subsidy in a manner that supports the\nhealth and well-being of their employees.\nEligible\nEmployers\nEligible\nemployers would include individuals, taxable corporations, partnerships\nconsisting of eligible employers, non-profit organizations and registered\ncharities.\nPublic\nbodies would not be eligible for this subsidy. Public bodies would generally include\nmunicipalities and local governments, Crown corporations, wholly owned\nmunicipal corporations, public universities, colleges, schools and hospitals.\nThis\nsubsidy would be available to eligible employers that see a drop of at least 15\nper cent of their revenue in March 2020 and 30\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent\nfor the following months (see Eligible\nPeriods). In applying for the subsidy, employers would be required to\nattest to the decline in revenue.\nWe encourage all\neligible employers to rehire employees as quickly as possible and to apply for\nthe Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy if they are eligible. To\nensure that the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)\napplies as intended, the Government will consider implementing an approach to\nlimit duplication.\xc2\xa0 This could include a process to allow individuals\nrehired by their employer during the same eligibility period to cancel\ntheir CERB claim and repay that amount.\nCalculating\nRevenues\nAn\nemployer\xe2\x80\x99s revenue for this purpose would be its revenue in Canada earned from\narm\xe2\x80\x99s-length sources. Revenue would be calculated using the employer\xe2\x80\x99s normal accounting\nmethod, and would exclude revenues from extraordinary items and amounts on\naccount of capital.\nToday, the government is\nclarifying that employers would be allowed to calculate their revenues under\nthe accrual method or the cash method, but not a combination of both. Employers\nwould select an accounting method when first applying for the CEWS and would be\nrequired to use that method for the entire duration of the program.\nFor registered\ncharities and non-profit organizations, the calculation will include most forms\nof revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm\xe2\x80\x99s length persons. These organizations\nwould be allowed to choose whether or not to include revenue from government\nsources as part of the calculation. Once chosen, the same approach would have\nto apply throughout the program period.\nAmount of Subsidy\nThe subsidy amount for a given employee on\neligible remuneration paid for the period between March 15 and June 6, 2020 would\nbe the greater of:\n75 per cent of the amount of\nremuneration paid, up to a maximum benefit of $847 per week; and\nthe amount of remuneration paid,\nup to a maximum benefit of $847 per week or 75 per cent of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s\npre-crisis weekly remuneration, whichever is less.\nIn\neffect, employers may be eligible for a subsidy of up to 100 per cent of the\nfirst 75 per cent of pre-crisis wages or salaries of existing employees. These\nemployers would be expected where possible to maintain existing employees\xe2\x80\x99\npre-crisis employment earnings.\nThe pre-crisis\nremuneration for a given employee would be based on the average weekly\nremuneration paid between January 1 and March 15 inclusively, excluding any\nseven-day periods in respect of which the employee did not receive remuneration.\nEmployers\nwill also be eligible for a subsidy of up to 75 per cent of salaries and wages\npaid to new employees.\nEligible\nremuneration may include salary, wages, and other remuneration like taxable\nbenefits. These are amounts for which employers would generally be required to\nwithhold or deduct amounts to remit to the Receiver General on account of the\nemployee\xe2\x80\x99s income tax obligation. However, it does not include severance pay, or\nitems such as stock option benefits or the personal use of a corporate vehicle.\nA special rule will apply to employees that do not deal at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length\nwith the employer. The subsidy amount for such employees will be limited to the eligible remuneration paid in any pay period between March 15\nand June 6, 2020, up to a maximum benefit of the lesser of $847 per week and 75\nper cent of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s pre-crisis weekly remuneration. The subsidy would\nonly be available in respect of non-arm\xe2\x80\x99s length employees employed prior to\nMarch\xc2\xa015, 2020.\nThere would be no\noverall limit on the subsidy amount that an eligible employer may claim.\nEmployers are\nexpected to make their best effort to top-up employees\xe2\x80\x99 salaries to bring them\nto pre-crisis levels.\nRefund for Certain Payroll Contributions\nToday, the Government is proposing to\nexpand the CEWS by introducing a new 100 per cent refund for certain employer-paid\ncontributions to Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec\nPension Plan, and the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan. This refund would cover\n100 per cent of employer-paid contributions for eligible employees for each week\nthroughout which those employees are on leave with pay and for which the\nemployer is eligible to claim for the CEWS for those employees.\nIn general, an employee will be considered to\nbe on leave with pay throughout a week if that employee is remunerated by the\nemployer for that week but does not perform any work for the employer in that\nweek. This refund would not be available for eligible employees that are on\nleave with pay for only a portion of a week.\nThis refund would\nnot be subject to the weekly maximum benefit per employee of $847 that an\neligible employer may claim in respect of the CEWS. There would be no overall\nlimit on the refund amount that an eligible employer may claim.\nFor greater\ncertainty, employers would be required to continue to collect and remit\nemployer and employee contributions to each program as usual. Eligible\nemployers would apply for a refund, as described above, at the same time that\nthey apply for the CEWS.\nEligible Periods\nEligibility would\ngenerally be determined by the change in an eligible employer\xe2\x80\x99s monthly\nrevenues, year-over-year, for the calendar month in which the period began.\nToday, the\ngovernment is announcing that all employers would be allowed to calculate their\nchange in revenue using an alternative benchmark to determine their\neligibility. This would provide more flexibility to employers for which the\ngeneral approach may not be appropriate, including high-growth firms, sectors\nthat faced difficulties in 2019, non-profits and charities, as well as\nemployers established after February 2019. Under this alternative approach, employers\nwould be allowed to compare their revenue using an average of their revenue earned\nin January and February 2020. Employers would select the general year-over-year\napproach or this alternative approach when first applying for the CEWS and would be required to use the same approach for\nthe entire duration of the program\nABC Inc. is a start-up that\nstarted its operations last September.\nIt reported revenues of $100,000 in January and $140,000 in February,\nfor a monthly average of $120,000. In March, its revenues dropped to $90,000.\nBecause revenues in March are 25 per cent lower than $120,000, ABC inc. would\nbe eligible for the CEWS for the first claiming period. To be eligible for the\nfollowing claiming period, ABC Inc. revenues would have to be $84,000 or less\nfor the month of April (that is, 30 per cent lower than $120,000).\nThe amount\nof wage subsidy (provided under the COVID-19 Economic Response\nPlan) received by\nthe employer in a given month would be ignored for the purpose of measuring\nyear-over-year changes in monthly revenues.\nFor\nexample, if revenues in March 2020 were down 20 per cent compared to March\n2019, the employer would be allowed to claim the CEWS (as calculated above) on\nremuneration paid between March\xc2\xa015 and April 11, 2020.\nAlternatively,\nthis employer could use its average revenue from the months of January and\nFebruary 2020, instead of March 2019, to determine if it is eligible for the CEWS.\nOnce an\napproach is chosen, the employer would have to apply it throughout the program\nperiod.\nThe table\nbelow outlines each claiming period, the required reduction in revenue and the\nreference period for eligibility.\nEligible Periods\nClaiming period\nRequired reduction in revenue\nReference period for eligibility\nPeriod 1\nMarch 15\nto\nApril 11\n15%\nMarch 2020 over:\nMarch 2019 or\nAverage of January and February 2020\nPeriod 2\nApril 12\nto\nMay 9\n30%\nApril 2020 over:\nApril 2019 or\nAverage of January and February 2020\nPeriod 3\nMay 10\nto\nJune 6\n30%\nMay 2020 over:\nMay 2019 or\nAverage of January and February 2020\nEligible employees\nAn eligible employee is an individual\nwho is employed in Canada.\nEligibility for the CEWS of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s remuneration, will be limited to employees that have not been without remuneration for more than 14 consecutive days in the eligibility period, i.e., from March 15 to April 11, from April 12 to May 9, and from May 10 to June 6.\nThis rule replaces the previously announced\nrestriction that an employer would not be eligible to claim the CEWS for\nremuneration paid to an employee in a week that falls within a 4-week period\nfor which the employee is eligible for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit.\nHow to\nApply\nEligible employers would be able to apply for the CEWS through the\nCanada Revenue Agency\xe2\x80\x99s My Business\nAccount portal as\nwell as a web-based application. Employers would have to keep records\ndemonstrating their reduction in arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length revenues and remuneration paid to\nemployees. More details about the application process will be made available\nshortly.\nEnsuring Compliance\nIn order to maintain the integrity of the program and to ensure that it\nhelps Canadians keep their jobs, the employer would be required to repay\namounts paid under the CEWS if they do not meet the eligibility requirements.\nPenalties may apply in cases of fraudulent claims. The\npenalties may include fines or even imprisonment. In addition, anti-abuse\nrules would be put in place to ensure that the subsidy is not inappropriately\nobtained and to help ensure that employees are paid the amounts they are owed.\nEmployers that engage in artificial\ntransactions to reduce revenue for the purpose of claiming the CEWS would be\nsubject to a penalty equal to 25 per cent of the value of the subsidy claimed,\nin addition to the requirement to repay in full the subsidy that was improperly\nclaimed.\nInteraction\nwith 10 per cent Wage Subsidy\nOn March 25, 2020, the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act,\nwhich included the implementation of a temporary 10 per cent wage subsidy,\nreceived Royal Assent. For employers that are eligible for both the CEWS and\nthe 10 per cent wage subsidy for a period, any benefit from the 10 per cent\nwage subsidy for remuneration paid in a specific period would generally reduce\nthe amount available to be claimed under the CEWS\nin that same period.\nInteraction with the Work-Sharing Program\nOn March 18, 2020, the Prime Minister announced\nan extension of the maximum duration of the Work-Sharing program from 38 weeks\nto 76 weeks for employers affected by COVID-19. This measure will provide\nincome support to employees eligible for Employment Insurance who agree to\nreduce their normal working hours because of developments beyond the control of\ntheir employers.\nFor employers and\nemployees that are participating in a Work-Sharing program, EI benefits\nreceived by employees through the Work-Sharing program will reduce the benefit\nthat their employer is entitled to receive under the CEWS.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe usual treatment of tax credits and other\nbenefits provided by the government would apply. As a consequence, the wage\nsubsidy received by an employer would be considered government assistance and be\nincluded in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s taxable income.\nAssistance received under either wage subsidy would\nreduce the amount of remuneration expenses eligible for other federal tax\ncredits calculated on the same remuneration.\nHow employers will benefit from\nthe CEWS\nMaude and St\xc3\xa9phane own a corporation that operates an automobile\nrepair shop in Saint Boniface, Manitoba. They are working full time, each drawing\na salary of $1,300 per week, and have three part-time employees, each earning $800\nper week, for a total weekly payroll of $5,000. Maude and St\xc3\xa9phane have reduced\ntheir opening hours due to decreased demand for their services. They had initially\nlaid off their employees, but they have now decided to re-hire them following\nthe announcement of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. Their employees are not being\nasked to report to work during this challenging period.\nMaude and St\xc3\xa9phane are now keeping their employees on the payroll,\npaying them 75 per cent of their pre-crisis salary ($600 per week). Maude and St\xc3\xa9phane\nwould be eligible for a weekly wage subsidy of $3,494 ($847 for each of themselves\nand $600 for each of their employees). Maude and St\xc3\xa9phane would also be\neligible for a 100-per-cent refund of their employer-paid contributions to\nEmployment Insurance and the Canada Pension Plan in respect of their employees,\nproviding an additional benefit of up to $124 per week.\nAt the end of each claiming period, Maude and St\xc3\xa9phane would submit\nan application through the Canada Revenue Agency portal, attesting that their\ndecline in revenues in each month is sufficient to qualify, when compared to\nthe average of January and February.

The overall increase for families receiving CCB will be\napproximately $550 on average; these families will receive an extra $300 per\nchild as part of their May payment. In total, this measure will deliver almost\n$2 billion in extra support.\nExtra time to file income taxes\nIn order to provide greater flexibility to Canadians who may be\nexperiencing hardships during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Canada Revenue Agency\nwill defer the filing due date for the 2019 tax returns of individuals,\nincluding certain trusts.\nFor individuals (other than trusts), the return filing due\ndate will be deferred until June 1, 2020. \xc2\xa0However, the Agency\nencourages individuals who expect to receive benefits under the GSTC or\nthe Canada Child Benefit not to delay the filing of their return to ensure\ntheir entitlements for the 2020-21 benefit year are properly determined.\nFor trusts having a taxation year ending on December 31,\n2019, the return filing due date will be deferred until May 1, 2020.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency will allow all taxpayers to defer, until\nafter August 31, 2020, the payment of any income tax amounts that become owing\non or after today and before September 2020. This relief would apply to tax\nbalances due, as well as instalments, under Part I of the\xc2\xa0Income Tax\nAct. No interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this\nperiod.\nIn order to reduce the necessity for taxpayers and tax preparers to\nmeet in person during this difficult time, and to reduce administrative burden,\neffective immediately the Canada Revenue Agency will recognize electronic\nsignatures as having met the signature requirements of the\xc2\xa0Income Tax\nAct, as a temporary administrative measure. This provision applies to\nauthorization forms T183 or T183CORP, which are forms that are signed in person\nby millions of Canadians every year to authorize tax preparers to file taxes.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency is adapting its Outreach Program to\nsupport individuals during COVID-19. Through this service, the Canada Revenue\nAgency offers help to individuals to better understand their tax obligations\nand to obtain the benefits and credits to which they are entitled.\nTraditionally available in-person, this service is now available over the\nphone, and through webinar, where possible.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency fully expects that many community\norganizations are considering whether to significantly reduce or perhaps cancel\nthe provision of services provided under the Community Volunteer Income Tax\nProgram. Additional efforts to encourage individuals to file their tax and\nbenefit returns electronically, or where possible, through the File My Return\nservice, will be put forward.\nMortgage support\nThe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and other\nmortgage insurers offer tools to lenders that can assist homeowners who may be\nexperiencing financial difficulty. These include payment deferral, loan\nre-amortization, capitalization of outstanding interest arrears and other\neligible expenses, and special payment arrangements.\nThe Government, through CMHC, is providing increased flexibility\nfor homeowners facing financial difficulties to defer mortgage payments on\nhomeowner CMHC-insured mortgage loans. CMHC will permit lenders to allow\npayment deferral beginning immediately.\nBanks in Canada have also affirmed their commitment to\nworking with customers to provide flexible solutions, on a case-by-case basis,\nfor managing through hardships caused by recent developments. This may include\nsituations such as pay disruption, childcare disruption, or illness. Canada\xe2\x80\x99s\nlarge banks have confirmed that this support will include up to a 6-month\npayment deferral for mortgages, and the opportunity for relief on other credit\nproducts. These targeted measures respond to immediate challenges being faced\nacross the country and will help stabilize the Canadian economy.\nSupport for people facing unemployment\nImproved access to Employment Insurance\nFor Canadians\xc2\xa0without paid sick leave (or similar\nworkplace accommodation) who are sick, quarantined or forced to stay home to\ncare for children, the Government is waiving the one-week waiting period for\nthose individuals in imposed quarantine that claim Employment Insurance (EI)\nsickness benefits. This temporary measure will be in effect as of March 15,\n2020.\nThe new Emergency Support Benefit\nFor Canadians who lose their jobs or face reduced hours as a\nresult of COVID\xe2\x80\x99s impact, the Government is introducing an Emergency Support\nBenefit delivered through the CRA to provide up to $5 billion in support to\nworkers who are not eligible for EI and who are facing unemployment.\nSupport for people sick or quarantined\nImproved access to Employment Insurance Sickness Benefit\nFor Canadians\xc2\xa0without paid sick leave (or similar\nworkplace accommodation) who are sick, quarantined or forced to stay home to\ncare for children, the Government is waiving the requirement to provide a\nmedical certificate to access EI sickness benefits.\nThe new Emergency Care Benefit\nIntroducing the Emergency Care Benefit\nproviding up to $900 bi-weekly, for up to 15 weeks. This flat-payment Benefit\nwould be administered through the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and provide\nincome support to:\nWorkers, including the self-employed, who are quarantined or sick\nwith COVID-19 but do not qualify for EI sickness benefits.\nWorkers, including the self-employed, who are taking care of a\nfamily member who is sick with COVID-19, such as an elderly parent, but do not\nqualify for EI sickness benefits.\nParents with children who require care or supervision due to\nschool or daycare closures, and are unable to earn employment income,\nirrespective of whether they qualify for EI or not.\nApplication for the Benefit will be available in April 2020, and\nrequire Canadians to attest that they meet the eligibility requirements. They\nwill need to re-attest every two weeks to reconfirm their eligibility.\nCanadians will select one of three channels to apply for the Benefit:\nby accessing it on their CRA MyAccount secure portal;\nby accessing it from their secure My Service Canada Account;\nor\nby calling a toll free number equipped with an automated\napplication process.\nSupport for People unable to work\nIntroducing the Emergency Care Benefit\nThe Government of Canada is introducing the\nEmergency Care Benefit providing up to $900 bi-weekly, for up to 15 weeks.

This will double the maximum annual GSTC payment amounts for the\n2019-20 benefit year. The average boost to income for those benefitting from\nthis measure will be close to $400 for single individuals and close to $600 for\ncouples. This measure will inject $5.5 billion into the economy.\nEnhancing the Reaching Home initiative\nProviding the Reaching Home initiative with\n$157.5 million to continue to support people experiencing homelessness during\nthe COVID-19 outbreak. The funding could be used for a range of needs such as\npurchasing beds and physical barriers for social distancing and securing\naccommodation to reduce overcrowding in shelters.\nSupport women\xe2\x80\x99s shelters and sexual assault centers\nThe Government of Canada is supporting women and children fleeing\nviolence, by providing up to $50 million to women\xe2\x80\x99s shelters and sexual assault\ncentres to help with their capacity to manage or prevent an outbreak in their\nfacilities.

This would provide a\n75-per-cent wage subsidy to eligible employers for up to 12 weeks, retroactive\nto March 15, 2020.\nThis wage subsidy aims to prevent\nfurther job losses, encourage employers to re-hire workers previously laid off\nas a result of COVID-19, and help better position Canadian companies and other employers\nto more easily resume normal operations following the crisis. While the\nGovernment has designed the proposed wage subsidy to provide generous and\ntimely financial support to employers, it has done so with the expectation that\nemployers will do their part by using the subsidy in a manner that supports the\nhealth and well-being of their employees.\nEligible\nEmployers\nEligible\nemployers would include individuals, taxable corporations, partnerships\nconsisting of eligible employers, non-profit organizations and registered\ncharities.\nPublic\nbodies would not be eligible for this subsidy. Public bodies would generally include\nmunicipalities and local governments, Crown corporations, wholly owned\nmunicipal corporations, public universities, colleges, schools and hospitals.\nThis\nsubsidy would be available to eligible employers that see a drop of at least 15\nper cent of their revenue in March 2020 and 30\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent\nfor the following months (see Eligible\nPeriods). In applying for the subsidy, employers would be required to\nattest to the decline in revenue.\nWe encourage all\neligible employers to rehire employees as quickly as possible and to apply for\nthe Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy if they are eligible. To\nensure that the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)\napplies as intended, the Government will consider implementing an approach to\nlimit duplication.\xc2\xa0 This could include a process to allow individuals\nrehired by their employer during the same eligibility period to cancel\ntheir CERB claim and repay that amount.\nCalculating\nRevenues\nAn\nemployer\xe2\x80\x99s revenue for this purpose would be its revenue in Canada earned from\narm\xe2\x80\x99s-length sources. Revenue would be calculated using the employer\xe2\x80\x99s normal accounting\nmethod, and would exclude revenues from extraordinary items and amounts on\naccount of capital.\nToday, the government is\nclarifying that employers would be allowed to calculate their revenues under\nthe accrual method or the cash method, but not a combination of both. Employers\nwould select an accounting method when first applying for the CEWS and would be\nrequired to use that method for the entire duration of the program.\nFor registered\ncharities and non-profit organizations, the calculation will include most forms\nof revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm\xe2\x80\x99s length persons. These organizations\nwould be allowed to choose whether or not to include revenue from government\nsources as part of the calculation. Once chosen, the same approach would have\nto apply throughout the program period.\nAmount of Subsidy\nThe subsidy amount for a given employee on\neligible remuneration paid for the period between March 15 and June 6, 2020 would\nbe the greater of:\n75 per cent of the amount of\nremuneration paid, up to a maximum benefit of $847 per week; and\nthe amount of remuneration paid,\nup to a maximum benefit of $847 per week or 75 per cent of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s\npre-crisis weekly remuneration, whichever is less.\nIn\neffect, employers may be eligible for a subsidy of up to 100 per cent of the\nfirst 75 per cent of pre-crisis wages or salaries of existing employees. These\nemployers would be expected where possible to maintain existing employees\xe2\x80\x99\npre-crisis employment earnings.\nThe pre-crisis\nremuneration for a given employee would be based on the average weekly\nremuneration paid between January 1 and March 15 inclusively, excluding any\nseven-day periods in respect of which the employee did not receive remuneration.\nEmployers\nwill also be eligible for a subsidy of up to 75 per cent of salaries and wages\npaid to new employees.\nEligible\nremuneration may include salary, wages, and other remuneration like taxable\nbenefits. These are amounts for which employers would generally be required to\nwithhold or deduct amounts to remit to the Receiver General on account of the\nemployee\xe2\x80\x99s income tax obligation. However, it does not include severance pay, or\nitems such as stock option benefits or the personal use of a corporate vehicle.\nA special rule will apply to employees that do not deal at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length\nwith the employer. The subsidy amount for such employees will be limited to the eligible remuneration paid in any pay period between March 15\nand June 6, 2020, up to a maximum benefit of the lesser of $847 per week and 75\nper cent of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s pre-crisis weekly remuneration. The subsidy would\nonly be available in respect of non-arm\xe2\x80\x99s length employees employed prior to\nMarch\xc2\xa015, 2020.\nThere would be no\noverall limit on the subsidy amount that an eligible employer may claim.\nEmployers are\nexpected to make their best effort to top-up employees\xe2\x80\x99 salaries to bring them\nto pre-crisis levels.\nRefund for Certain Payroll Contributions\nToday, the Government is proposing to\nexpand the CEWS by introducing a new 100 per cent refund for certain employer-paid\ncontributions to Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec\nPension Plan, and the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan. This refund would cover\n100 per cent of employer-paid contributions for eligible employees for each week\nthroughout which those employees are on leave with pay and for which the\nemployer is eligible to claim for the CEWS for those employees.\nIn general, an employee will be considered to\nbe on leave with pay throughout a week if that employee is remunerated by the\nemployer for that week but does not perform any work for the employer in that\nweek. This refund would not be available for eligible employees that are on\nleave with pay for only a portion of a week.\nThis refund would\nnot be subject to the weekly maximum benefit per employee of $847 that an\neligible employer may claim in respect of the CEWS. There would be no overall\nlimit on the refund amount that an eligible employer may claim.\nFor greater\ncertainty, employers would be required to continue to collect and remit\nemployer and employee contributions to each program as usual. Eligible\nemployers would apply for a refund, as described above, at the same time that\nthey apply for the CEWS.\nEligible Periods\nEligibility would\ngenerally be determined by the change in an eligible employer\xe2\x80\x99s monthly\nrevenues, year-over-year, for the calendar month in which the period began.\nToday, the\ngovernment is announcing that all employers would be allowed to calculate their\nchange in revenue using an alternative benchmark to determine their\neligibility. This would provide more flexibility to employers for which the\ngeneral approach may not be appropriate, including high-growth firms, sectors\nthat faced difficulties in 2019, non-profits and charities, as well as\nemployers established after February 2019. Under this alternative approach, employers\nwould be allowed to compare their revenue using an average of their revenue earned\nin January and February 2020. Employers would select the general year-over-year\napproach or this alternative approach when first applying for the CEWS and would be required to use the same approach for\nthe entire duration of the program\nABC Inc. is a start-up that\nstarted its operations last September.\nIt reported revenues of $100,000 in January and $140,000 in February,\nfor a monthly average of $120,000. In March, its revenues dropped to $90,000.\nBecause revenues in March are 25 per cent lower than $120,000, ABC inc. would\nbe eligible for the CEWS for the first claiming period. To be eligible for the\nfollowing claiming period, ABC Inc. revenues would have to be $84,000 or less\nfor the month of April (that is, 30 per cent lower than $120,000).\nThe amount\nof wage subsidy (provided under the COVID-19 Economic Response\nPlan) received by\nthe employer in a given month would be ignored for the purpose of measuring\nyear-over-year changes in monthly revenues.\nFor\nexample, if revenues in March 2020 were down 20 per cent compared to March\n2019, the employer would be allowed to claim the CEWS (as calculated above) on\nremuneration paid between March\xc2\xa015 and April 11, 2020.\nAlternatively,\nthis employer could use its average revenue from the months of January and\nFebruary 2020, instead of March 2019, to determine if it is eligible for the CEWS.\nOnce an\napproach is chosen, the employer would have to apply it throughout the program\nperiod.\nThe table\nbelow outlines each claiming period, the required reduction in revenue and the\nreference period for eligibility.\nEligible Periods\nClaiming period\nRequired reduction in revenue\nReference period for eligibility\nPeriod 1\nMarch 15\nto\nApril 11\n15%\nMarch 2020 over:\nMarch 2019 or\nAverage of January and February 2020\nPeriod 2\nApril 12\nto\nMay 9\n30%\nApril 2020 over:\nApril 2019 or\nAverage of January and February 2020\nPeriod 3\nMay 10\nto\nJune 6\n30%\nMay 2020 over:\nMay 2019 or\nAverage of January and February 2020\nEligible employees\nAn eligible employee is an individual\nwho is employed in Canada.\nEligibility for the CEWS of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s remuneration, will be limited to employees that have not been without remuneration for more than 14 consecutive days in the eligibility period, i.e., from March 15 to April 11, from April 12 to May 9, and from May 10 to June 6.\nThis rule replaces the previously announced\nrestriction that an employer would not be eligible to claim the CEWS for\nremuneration paid to an employee in a week that falls within a 4-week period\nfor which the employee is eligible for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit.\nHow to\nApply\nEligible employers would be able to apply for the CEWS through the\nCanada Revenue Agency\xe2\x80\x99s My Business\nAccount portal as\nwell as a web-based application. Employers would have to keep records\ndemonstrating their reduction in arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length revenues and remuneration paid to\nemployees. More details about the application process will be made available\nshortly.\nEnsuring Compliance\nIn order to maintain the integrity of the program and to ensure that it\nhelps Canadians keep their jobs, the employer would be required to repay\namounts paid under the CEWS if they do not meet the eligibility requirements.\nPenalties may apply in cases of fraudulent claims. The\npenalties may include fines or even imprisonment. In addition, anti-abuse\nrules would be put in place to ensure that the subsidy is not inappropriately\nobtained and to help ensure that employees are paid the amounts they are owed.\nEmployers that engage in artificial\ntransactions to reduce revenue for the purpose of claiming the CEWS would be\nsubject to a penalty equal to 25 per cent of the value of the subsidy claimed,\nin addition to the requirement to repay in full the subsidy that was improperly\nclaimed.\nInteraction\nwith 10 per cent Wage Subsidy\nOn March 25, 2020, the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act,\nwhich included the implementation of a temporary 10 per cent wage subsidy,\nreceived Royal Assent. For employers that are eligible for both the CEWS and\nthe 10 per cent wage subsidy for a period, any benefit from the 10 per cent\nwage subsidy for remuneration paid in a specific period would generally reduce\nthe amount available to be claimed under the CEWS\nin that same period.\nInteraction with the Work-Sharing Program\nOn March 18, 2020, the Prime Minister announced\nan extension of the maximum duration of the Work-Sharing program from 38 weeks\nto 76 weeks for employers affected by COVID-19. This measure will provide\nincome support to employees eligible for Employment Insurance who agree to\nreduce their normal working hours because of developments beyond the control of\ntheir employers.\nFor employers and\nemployees that are participating in a Work-Sharing program, EI benefits\nreceived by employees through the Work-Sharing program will reduce the benefit\nthat their employer is entitled to receive under the CEWS.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe usual treatment of tax credits and other\nbenefits provided by the government would apply. As a consequence, the wage\nsubsidy received by an employer would be considered government assistance and be\nincluded in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s taxable income.\nAssistance received under either wage subsidy would\nreduce the amount of remuneration expenses eligible for other federal tax\ncredits calculated on the same remuneration.\nHow employers will benefit from\nthe CEWS\nMaude and St\xc3\xa9phane own a corporation that operates an automobile\nrepair shop in Saint Boniface, Manitoba. They are working full time, each drawing\na salary of $1,300 per week, and have three part-time employees, each earning $800\nper week, for a total weekly payroll of $5,000. Maude and St\xc3\xa9phane have reduced\ntheir opening hours due to decreased demand for their services. They had initially\nlaid off their employees, but they have now decided to re-hire them following\nthe announcement of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. Their employees are not being\nasked to report to work during this challenging period.\nMaude and St\xc3\xa9phane are now keeping their employees on the payroll,\npaying them 75 per cent of their pre-crisis salary ($600 per week). Maude and St\xc3\xa9phane\nwould be eligible for a weekly wage subsidy of $3,494 ($847 for each of themselves\nand $600 for each of their employees). Maude and St\xc3\xa9phane would also be\neligible for a 100-per-cent refund of their employer-paid contributions to\nEmployment Insurance and the Canada Pension Plan in respect of their employees,\nproviding an additional benefit of up to $124 per week.\nAt the end of each claiming period, Maude and St\xc3\xa9phane would submit\nan application through the Canada Revenue Agency portal, attesting that their\ndecline in revenues in each month is sufficient to qualify, when compared to\nthe average of January and February. They would also report the total\nremuneration paid to themselves and their furloughed employees during the month.\nAs Maude and St\xc3\xa9phane have access to direct deposits with the Canada Revenue\nAgency, they would receive their subsidy shortly after each application.\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\nPlease select all that apply:\nA link, button or video is not working\nIt has a spelling mistake\nInformation is missing\nInformation is outdated or wrong\nLogin error when trying to access an account (e.g. My Service Canada Account)\nGC Key access\nSecureKey Concierge (Banking Credential) access\nPersonal Access Code (PAC) problems or EI Access Code (AC) problems\nSocial Insurance Number (SIN) validation problems\nOther login error not in this list\nI can\'t find what I\'m looking for\nOther issue not in this list\nSubmit\nThank you for your help!\nYou will not receive a reply.
